I lowered my head.  My feet were almost in line with hers.  I looked down at her, and she looked down at me, keeping only a partial eye on the ongoing brawl.

“I do.  But it’s my natural state,” I said.  I thought of what Peter had mentioned.  “Something-”

“Incomplete,” she said.

Their mouths were wide and crowded with teeth.  Their teeth and fingernails looked like they’d been collected from people who’d lost theirs.  Diseased, cavity-ridden to the point I could see through some, torn, splintered, crusted with plaque or fungus…

The rest of them were so featureless that it almost suggested there was nothing to them but tooth and nail.  They seemed fairly craven, shying away as Eva’s eye fell on them.  Mustering up the courage as more crawled up from downstairs.</div>Aahhhhhahaaaaaaa noooooo</span>

Plus, Callan's just been on Molly's side for most of this, and while he hasn't gone about it in the <em>best</em> way possible (he punches a lot) out of all the Shitty Thorburns (as E&amp;R have dubbed them) he's far from the worst in terms of what we've seen from each of them in the story. Peter, Roxy, and Ellie in particular have had moments of 'oh they're just fuckin psycho'- I'm still hoping that Peter gets some sort of redemption but that's besides the point and maybe just because I've started really liking him- but Callan so far has shown nothing but protectiveness towards his siblings.

My sweatshirt hung open, so I could reach into the side of my chest, and the shirt beneath was tattered enough to show the damage.  There was more flesh at the legs and buttocks, out of sight, and I hadn’t yet seen my groin turn to wood and bird, but I assumed it was a matter of time.

I still had a gaping hole in the middle of my chest.

Where others might have gotten spoiled or indolent, Kathryn had flourished under the combination of Uncle Paul and Aunt Steph and found some ambition.  She had a desire to be something more from Uncle Paul, knowledge on how to game the system from Aunt Steph, and unlike Callan, Kathryn hadn’t suffered the crushing disappointment of realizing she might never inherit the house.  She’d found her own path.  A path with a lot of victims and scapegoats left in her wake, but a path nonetheless.

This, right here, was Kathryn in a situation that was utterly alien to her.  The murder-reaper-thing, the clockwork man, the homonculi, a hallway drenched in blood and a long-lost cousin in a mirror weren’t the things she was having a hard time dealing with.

I suspected it had more to do with the fact that she was, for maybe the first time in her life, the only one truly accountable for her actions and their consequences.</div></span>

A length of green wood will serve as a conduit for the living energies to vacate the dead prison that confine them.  Natural energies, too, will suffice, with daylight, running water from a natural source, lightning strikes, clean fire if the Bane is not pre-treated, a spike of crystal, or a stalagmite with a history of attachment to the ground serving to provide this conduit of natural forces.  Like the Nosferatu, the Bane is a wretched thing, and death should be seen as a mercy.</div>Well that's just <em>real</em> useful at the moment. Makes sense, with life opposing death, but I don't think they have any of that on hand. I also love that the book prescribes emotional responses to killing things; it's so hilariously awful. Especially when the first half of the book was how to create one by doing a bunch of horrible things</span>

“They’re bad,” I stated.

“Better or worse than what’s out in that hallway, making their way in?”

Something wispy was starting to creep into the library.  Tiff stepped forward to banish it with a dash of salt.

“Can I get back to you on that?” I asked.</div></span>

“You’ve basically summed up the last few weeks of my life,” I said.

“That’s reality,” Ellie said.  “Everyone tells you to do this, do that, there are rules and they fuck you in the ass if you obey them, and if you don’t obey them, then they fuck you in the ass.”

Ellie, I’m not interested in discussing it,” Tiff said, her voice tense, “because I think you’re wrong.  You guys don’t have a monopoly on shitty families, and you don’t have a monopoly on shitty circumstances.  My family’s personalities were worse, I’m pretty sure my upbringing sucked more than yours, and I still believe what I believe.

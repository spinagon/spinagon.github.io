A rabbit leaped from the midst of the snow to claw and bite Conquest’s arm, failing to get far with the white, leathery skin-fabric covering in the way.

I couldn’t say for sure, but a part of me wondered if a being like Conquest remained as afraid of demons as the rest of us.  He was immortal, few things could touch him on a fundamental level, but when you lived by a concept, and you faced down a being that could subvert that concept…</div>Like I've said, much of the motivation for Conquest in the first place comes from fear and insecurity, the need to control because you're afraid of what the world might do to you if you don't. There are other motivators: vengeance, attempting to 'share prosperity'...but if you think of them right, it's kind of tantamount to fear.

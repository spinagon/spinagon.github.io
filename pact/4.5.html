The imp hopped onto the roof of the car, while a skeletal dog climbed up and wormed through the hole in the window, the edges of the glass slicing it here and there.

I could see the dog through the car windows, moving in between the driver and passenger seats, into the back seat of the car.  Not sitting there, but hiding on the floor of the car.

“Huh?”

“When they see the damage, they’ll look,” I said.  “It’s… close as I can figure, the only way they’re going to see the dog that’s inside the car.  Maybe they’ll shit themselves when they walk over to the second broken window and the dog starts barking and snapping, but at least they won’t find out about the dog while they’re driving on a busy road and it bites their arm or throat.”</div> Blake does this a lot, where he retroactively assigns motivation to his instinctive actions. Firstly, that's a <em>really</em> cool character trait that I've never seen done in quite this way before. Also, I wonder how good he is at this kind of self-reflection. I mean, in this case I believe him. So far, he's been all <em>about</em> mitigating the damage to the common person when he can. But it's also not like he thinks about breaking the window, or weighs the cost of the window and that damage against the cost of a possible accident. Not a difficult choice to make, sure, but he doesn't have a hint of that process show up consciously. 
Maybe <em>that's</em> part of what makes Blake seem like a more distanced protagonist than Taylor, Sy, or Vicky: he doesn't have that kind of thing bouncing around in his conscious head, so his actions almost feel like they're being taken by someone else until after the fact.</span>

Maybe that's a stretch, but I'm wondering more and more if there are any sources of magic and Otherhood that <em>aren't</em> human. From right now to when the pyramids were constructed is a 20th of the time humans have been around; that's enough time to become <em>warped</em> somehow. And hey, maybe after the first few things that are goblin-like are created out of a weird sludge of the primal spirits, humans, and animals, they can self-propagate. 
But one thing I love about Worm is that the structures of magic come from <em>people</em>, and I have trouble believing that Pact is any different in that regard. Stretching the boundaries of what we can call a person? Sure! Breaking them explicitly? Never.</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">If I was going to armor myself in my own self and identity, I’d damn well stick to my preference of being clean shaven.  I’d spent too many weeks with wispy teenaged beard growth while I’d been on the streets.  I was going to be the best Blake Thorburn I could imagine.  The sort of Blake who could look good in an almost-suit, but still pull off his button-up shirt and start working on framing a new art installation, or do prop work for the theater, or something.  I’d armor myself in my personal ideal, hold it up to give myself courage in a situation where I had very, very little.</div> Yeah!!! Also stop dicking around!

The Dowghty house was the only one that had no lights at all.  Flocks of crows took off as I approached, but they didn’t attack me.</div> I didn't anticipate Blake having to maybe carry out Rose's plan all by himself</span>

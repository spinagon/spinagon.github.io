If I don’t say something, then it becomes this thing we don’t talk about, like the time my mom and my dad separated for a while when I was really young, and my mom had a boyfriend right away after my dad left, and my parents got back together and nobody ever talks about the guy that was around back then, like they think- thought I didn’t remember.”</div>YES.

And maybe he doesn't <em>completely</em> get it either, I don't think I completely get it <em>now</em>, but it's just such a wonderfully mature way of handling this issue.</span>

It works in a pretty "Categorical Imperative" kind of way, evaluating actions individually and without context. But Blb, among other things, is interested in rewriting those rules to allow for safer breaches of karma in service of the good.

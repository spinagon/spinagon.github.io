Sheridan, it’s your choice if you want to bring the trash from the car and the leftover car snacks or if you want to bring in the big bags from the back.”

“Wonderful, love it,” Sheridan said.

“You really need to work on your lying,” their mom said.

“Take in the trash or be a beast of burden.”

“I’d give you the option of groceries but I think you do intentional harm to things like bread or eggs whenever I do.”

Sheridan ascribed to a philosophy of ‘do a job badly enough and you won’t get asked to do it again’.  Which had backfired more than a few times, but that only made her dig in harder.

“Oh, Grumble’s up,” Rowan said.

Grumble stood in the doorway, only seemingly able to stay upright because their dad was holding onto his armpit.</code>With mere hours until the fight breaks out, it's interesting that we cut back to/check in with the Kelly family beforehand, still in the calm before the storm.

“Shul’ john in.  Brin ‘er in.”

“That’d be a picture.  What’s the group demographic like?”

“Lots of people in Grumble’s age group,” her dad said.  “That’s why they’re accommodating of him bringing in a video summary.

“But,” Avery’s mom said, and she reached out to Avery, giving Avery a squeeze on the shoulder.  “You have to be able to stop when it’s called for, like when feelings get hurt, or on nights like tonight, where we want to have as many positive vibes going around as possible.  When the chips are down, we support each other.”

The nods and reactions ranged from Rowan being receptive to Declan’s barely restrained eye roll.  Kerry seemed to be listening but who knew what would be flying through her glitter-dusted, wide-eyed head an hour from now?</code>This is a nice little moment of trying to actually corral the family into a semblance of unified support, break through the constant back-and-forth of the day-to-day. I don't think Kelsey always draws the line between support and snark in the right place but it's good for someone to articulate that. Also, I'm of course reminded of Verona here, and it makes me think about Connor having very similar coping strategies to her. In a universe where Connor did become a more active practitioner in the field, I could see the two of them having a lot of fun working together on a case.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1093841605947035780" id="chatlog__message-container-1093841605947035780"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, April 7, 2023 1:16 PM">1:16 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">I do want to point out how Avery still sort of...underestimates Kerry?

Kerry looked like she was going to throw a fit when Declan was the one to do the final motion of opening the box, but then she looked inside.

“This is so much better than a puppy!”

“Volume!  Quiet for sensitive ears.”

Snowdrop looked up at them from the bottom of the box, which was littered with the remains of the fruits and vegetables that had been put in there with her.</code>See!?

“I’m glad you’re not as far away tonight, how’s that?”

“Same, I think,” she replied, turning to let herself and Rowan into the house.</code>Wow, we're getting a lot of positive Kelly sibling interactions this chapter.

Maybe Avery was reading too much into it.</code>I'd guess that Avery- having been in a similar position before, at a time when the family wasn't focusing on her -probably has pretty good instincts here.

As the containers were all broken open and portions divvied out, Snowdrop figured out she could climb between Kerry and Declan and the two of them were her best bet at getting bits of food.

Declan seemed to be pretty happy with that, even if he tried hard not to show it.  Kerry whispered in his ears, probably telling him to play it cool, and Avery, at the same time, signaled Snowdrop to not eat too much and get too full to be useful tonight.

This is perfect, she thought.</code></span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1093843685822697522" id="chatlog__message-container-1093843685822697522"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, April 7, 2023 1:24 PM">1:24 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><img alt="bulba" class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--large" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/356879968552353802.png" title="bulba"/></span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1093844594531242004" id="chatlog__message-container-1093844594531242004"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, April 7, 2023 1:27 PM">1:27 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">To her right, Declan and Kerry were charmed by Snowdrop, which was a good enough distraction.

Not that much.  Hmmmm.  Like, oh hey, I can use this alchemy and this diagram and suddenly I’m breaking rules and doing wild stuff, right?”

“But instead of alchemy and diagrams it’s… a friend and the team, or it’s a pair of people in a relationship and a party, or… yeah.”

“Wow.  It’d be cool if you could- no, that sounds bad.  I don’t want to say ‘you could learn something from her’, because you’re doing great with the markets and outreach and obviously you have your talents,” Lucy said.

“Sure.”

“But man, wouldn’t it be great to learn to…”

“Be a social artist?” Avery asked.  “Social engineer?”

“Yeah.  I’d say I want to learn to do that, but I’m not in Thunder Bay.”</code>I love this comparison between Putnam and Verona because it perfectly describes Verona's fae-like energies: very particular and involved and interesting-thing-oriented, but doesn't think as much about social positioning aspects. It's always been interesting that the gang mostly shares the burden when it comes to social engineering- they all have their own moments and none of them are stand-out adept at it, as Lucy kind of points out here. I think it'd be interesting if Lucy learned a bit of that, maybe calling in a favor from Florin or paying Fernanda for lessons. Avery really does attract a lot of social-manipulator friends, doesn't she? I can see why. People adept at social positioning and manipulation love a still-sociable but more genuine presence to bounce off of and ground them. They're easy to mess with in small ways, fun to be around, and good to have in your corner to lean on when problems rise up. Not that I would know of course.

“Fair.  I don’t think I’m that good at anything.”

“Your ability to argue, keep a bunch of things in mind, like you’re juggling them.  Whether you’re on a battlefield or arguing with Musser.”

“Hm.  I guess.  I feel like that’s more like something a lot of people can do.”</code>Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha that's kind of great- of course Lucy doesn't recognize the skills she already has in the interactions department. But yeah, when you're good at this kind of thing it can be difficult to actually realize it. Like, I'm still learning to accept that I've got a pretty good memory when it comes to most kinds of research, especially when it involves people or society in any capacity- systemizing knowledge, I guess. Remembering details of stories and worldbuilding, ideologies and historical events, social dynamics and things people tell me about themselves.

Her mom relented, going quiet.

Verona had asked for the space to speak, but now that she was here, she didn’t seem to know what to say.

Avery hadn’t seen her tongue tied like this very often.

“There’s some pretty good reasons.  I have a sales pitch.  Way better than you’re probably imagining,” Verona said.

Because I found a version of me I’m okay with and I don’t think there are many other versions of me that are good for me or for you… and I get the feeling you’re- you’re in the same boat, maybe.”

“It’s a little more complicated than that,” Avery said.

“Maybe.  But even without those extra complications… if we’re each clinging to the ‘normal’ we’ve managed to scrounge up after a lot of work, can either one of us budge?”</code>That's...it's not fair but it makes sense. But if Sylvia understands this about Verona, then she understands that neither of them budging will just tear holes in each other's lives. It's an unwinnable situation. I was going to say 'but then Sylvia will get her way because she has the power; she's the adult in the situation' and normally that <em>would</em> be true but I think most of what happens is that Jas pushes harder and creates rifts.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1093859190767882321" id="chatlog__message-container-1093859190767882321"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, April 7, 2023 2:25 PM">2:25 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Maybe I’m owed you… budging?  Maybe-”

Her voice shook a little.

“Maybe I’m tired of being the one constantly letting go, having to take the leap, getting my own damn house when I can’t be at Dad’s, starting a business, and finding people and… why is it always me making the sacrifices?  Can’t I, just this once, say, fuck, you let go, you budge?”

Avery glanced at Lucy.

A good three or four seconds passed without anyone speaking up.</code>And that's the rub. It sucks, because I can really see myself in Sylvia too- how certain things would feel like...like asking me to destroy myself slowly. Like living in a desert with endless heat and sun burning away any will I have to live my life. I <em>can</em> imagine being asked that, and I can imagine it sucking pretty friggin hard.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1093859511242072174" id="chatlog__message-container-1093859511242072174"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, April 7, 2023 2:27 PM">2:27 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“I’m not even asking you to agree to it right now.

“You keep saying things that I can’t get my head around.  What are you even talking about?”

“That’s the point though, isn’t it?” Verona asked.  “I’ve got to reach out.  I’ve got to be the one to explain.  I’ve got to be the one to take the risks and make the sacrifices.  I’ve been going my own way, figuring it out and now I’m being asked to fill you in on the full story, and it’s fucked.”</code>Being forced to take responsibility for one's own conception, the parental roles entirely flipped.

I feel like, if you were really listening, really taking me seriously-”

“I am.”

“-you would’ve asked more about that.  That’s the bad fucked thing.”

“You said you didn’t want to share yet.  That it was waiting for the meeting, with the other parents.  After the stuff with the house fire blows over.”</code>From the ways she's been acting this whole conversation I do actually believe that. She takes notice when Verona says absolutely insane things, when it feels like Brett barely even listens.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1093860054588981289" id="chatlog__message-container-1093860054588981289"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, April 7, 2023 2:29 PM">2:29 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Brett just has a bunch of keywords where if you say them he launches on specific parts of his neverending tantrum.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1093860545532284989" id="chatlog__message-container-1093860545532284989"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, April 7, 2023 2:31 PM">2:31 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“You don’t know,” Verona said.  “There is no hospital stay.

“Ronnie?” Avery asked.

Sylvia was frowning now.

“It sucks, it’s unfair, huh?” Verona asked.  “Not cool to you to hold info back, then get mad at you for not knowing.  But I’m stuck in something big here, I can’t leave it, I’ve got to go handle it, and if you’d met me partway before or even tonight, I don’t think much would be held back and we wouldn’t be in this mess.”

“What’s going on?”

“And as unfair as that may be, or may not be, I dunno.  I don’t think you’ve been fair to me here, either.

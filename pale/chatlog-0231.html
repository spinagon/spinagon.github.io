She held the phone at her side and stared out over toward broader Kennet, toward ski-hills that shimmered slightly with summer heat.</code>We return to Lucy, who perhaps hasn't had her date <em>ruined</em> yet, because first of all that implies a <em>significant</em> drop in quality and what with the other datemates...generally being unhelpful who knows what the quality was to begin with, and second of all...I mean, nothing has to be done immediately, it's just now the information is hanging over her head along with everything else.

It's kind of adorable either way. I like Wallace. I was kind of afraid he'd be more of an asshole when everyone else was around in sort of a Declans-esque way but I'm proud of him for the way he's acted so far.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="864867996886630470" id="chatlog__message-container-864867996886630470"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, July 14, 2021 4:56 PM">4:56 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Sometimes you look like you’re concerned about everything…”

“Wise words,” Mia chimed in.  “So true.”

Lucy smiled.  “Concerning in a not-jokey way.”

“Other times you look okay, and you smile or you’re not smiling with your mouth, but your eyes…”</code>And he also seems to be fairly insightful here, like he's spent time paying close attention to Lucy and maybe thinking about her a lot. I suppose it might not be right to call it insight, because I don't know if this stuff is all that hard to notice when you're watching someone. I think what I admire is his openness about it, his willingness to say what he notices pretty directly, without too much reservation. We also saw a bit of that in how he answered Lucy's questions about self-advocacy and why he agreed to that kind of date in the first place. Also that little snippet of conversation mixed with the one Xavier and Emerson had earlier are both poking and prodding at Lucy's tendency to just make decisions for groups of people because she's been met with so much indecisiveness. I wonder if that's something we're going to explore? That people will sometimes just go along with things that they're unhappy with rather than argue against her, and how she can account for that?</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="864868932275798046" id="chatlog__message-container-864868932275798046"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, July 14, 2021 5:00 PM">5:00 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“That’s what I was noticing,” Mia said.  “Earlier, when I mentioned-”

Lucy turned her head to the right and gave Mia her best withering stare.

“I’ll… trail a few feet behind and enjoy this breeze.  You carry on.”</code>I'd say she needs to learn something from Mia where that's concerned, but I'm not sure Mia's got the right way of doing things either. She's kind of not being helpful right now, though that has less to do with her leadership strategy and more to do with...okay it actually does have <em>some</em> to do with leadership strategy, the ways in which she decides to push people.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="864869643512053781" id="chatlog__message-container-864869643512053781"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, July 14, 2021 5:03 PM">5:03 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Avery:

She put the phone away.

Avery would probably be more upset if Lucy had to bail now than Lucy would.</code>Damn straight. Avery's going to hold off the whole BHI with the sheer unbridled power she draws from her belief in romantic love. Which is a problem we can address later. It <em>is</em> wholesome at the moment, that it makes Lucy feel okay continuing this date, especially since she and Wallace are sort of just getting their moments away from the group.

It was ironic that the movie theater in Kennet was closed for so much of the year, but the Catholic school was an option.  During the summer days, senior students in school uniforms managed the two auditoriums, turning them into an impromptu movie theater to raise funds.  There was a dinky little concession stand, the theater itself had an inexpensive sound system, and the projector wasn’t all that.

At the same time, it was air conditioned, it was convenient, tickets to crappy movies were three dollars and fifty cents, and a combination of a movie ticket with small popcorn and a can of soda was five dollars total.  Some younger kids would spend a portion of their summers here, depending on what was on the screen.  Ones that had finished watching their movies were outside, waiting for parents, running around the… moat, Lucy decided to call it, that surrounded St. Victor’s.  Waterless at the moment, it was more of a broad, shallow L-shaped ditch around the side of the school that caught runoff and redirected it toward a storm drain.</code>This description is reminiscent of Lucy's descriptions of her classmates, like she puts them in a different category from everything else in the story. A 'mundane teenage life' category that she still struggles with. I really like just seeing the <em>place</em> that is Kennet from Lucy's perspective, in all of its contradictions, because she pulls no punches in terms of being critical of it, but it's still her home and she finds the good things about it too.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="864871888457826306" id="chatlog__message-container-864871888457826306"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, July 14, 2021 5:12 PM">5:12 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">The idea that things were dissolving into chaos out there dogged Lucy.

She wanted so much, yet the majority of that ‘so much‘ was little things.

For Verona, magic sort of <em>is</em> the world at this point. I don't think she really sees as stark a difference between the relationships she makes in the magical world and the ones she makes in the mundane world anymore, because really everything is in its <em>own</em> world.

As enthusiastic as Avery was about wanting to vicariously enjoy stuff and be a champion of crushes and blushes and requited love and whatever else, that had to suck?  There was also this feeling she had, where she was suspicious that if Avery was going to find love, it would be through the magic.  Like she could go somewhere, and it’d happen.  Or maybe Liberty, but she was even more reluctant to push for that particular pairing than she was with Verona and Jeremy.</code>Interesting...I've been (frequently) struggling a bit to place Avery in Lucy's framework here, but I think she does a pretty good job. Avery sees everything magic and mundane as equally alien to her, I think. Equally...apart. She tries to build these sorts of connections and does so primarily through the magical world, though that almost seems circumstantial, just because it's what she's focused on right now. I wonder why Lucy is so reluctant to ship Liberty and Avery (even though I'm glad she sees that potential too)? Is it because of that still-unaddressed prejudice she's got on her shoulders, the prejudice against ugly and jarring things in the Practice?

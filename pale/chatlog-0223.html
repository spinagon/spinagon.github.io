Maricica herself has worked against Kennet’s citizens, raising suspicion and threatening what our council and collective are trying to accomplish.”</code>And we jump back into the meeting! It's going to be interesting. I really <em>want</em> the lesson of this situation to be "all that dodging around and political positioning is less productive than actually getting the community together and working in a joint interest" but I can also already see some points of contention that could snag here. For example, Toadswallow is a goblin and could be accused of faerie prejudice which might not even be 100% false, and his position as a leader could be challenged. Maricica also still has friends among the innocent, Alpy among them.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861602939436662784" id="chatlog__message-container-861602939436662784"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 4:42 PM">4:42 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Some of the newly arrived Others were settling in.

No Charles.  It seemed like Edith was being left alone with just the Sable’s binding, which was supposed to be enough.</code>Just gonna put another tally in the 'mentioning Charles' absence' post-it. He's probably not dead. Probably. I feel like- and don't get me wrong here -Kennet's Others as a whole would immediately feel a lot better if Charles just died. So it's probably worse than that.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861603472705323039" id="chatlog__message-container-861603472705323039"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 4:44 PM">4:44 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Toadswallow looked around the group.  “We must move with care.  The glitterpriss has dealt with all of us and if she is indeed against us, then we have to reconsider every interaction she’s had with us.  But by doing that, we open ourselves up to vulnerability, further manipulation, and schemes.  With your permission, as your elected head, I’ll guide this discussion past that for the now.  This is not a time for condemnation or holding a trial by proxy.  This isn’t a time for panic, or twisting ourselves in knots.  Agreed?”

There were nods all around.</code>Seems to be going well so far- and let's just give a big round of applause to Toadswallow because he handles this like a fucking champ, saying pretty much exactly what the assembled people need to hear to get themselves on track. I think I agree that if Rook had been elected this kind of motion would've been a whole lot harder to get passed.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861605100137218069" id="chatlog__message-container-861605100137218069"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 4:51 PM">4:51 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“We hold her in exile until such a time as she brings herself to us for explanation and discussion.

Would anyone here, practitioner or Other, wish for different treatment?”

He went one by one, checking with a pointed finger.  Each person murmured a negation or shook their heads.</code>And it's not only emotionally thorough but bureaucratically so, getting explicit confirmation from everyone. Just by like...only swearing once through this entire speech, Toadswallow really conveys the 'shit got real' tone without it seeming like a farce. Like he's still clearly himself, he creates comfort in that, but the thing about swearing up a storm is that it tends to portray the subject of said swearing as something to be dismissed, and Toadswallow is taking great care <em>not</em> to dismiss any of the emotional or legal weight of the situation.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861605403681882112" id="chatlog__message-container-861605403681882112"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 4:52 PM">4:52 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Yeah.

Even a nightmare like Alpeana needed someone to confide in and it sure seemed like Maricica had been that someone.  A big sister figure, maybe.

That was a thing, wasn’t it?  That things were so interconnected that any betrayal, big or small, was something that hit a lot of people really hard.</code>Because...yeah.

Use your best judgment, or the judgment of smarter or senior Others on the scene.  Newcomers, that means listening to those who’ve been around longer, unless you have good reason to believe they’re playing into the Carmine Conspiracy.”

There were nods all around.

“I’ll ask those here for your thoughts.  Guilherme, you knew her best,” Toadswallow said.</code>This is where it's going to get interesting, because there are multiple ways in which we can't be totally sure that Guilherme can be trusted. There's the obvious 'he might be in on it/working towards his own goals' to consider, but also he's solidifying to Winter and his words have to be taken in that context. He's losing his sense and articulation of naunce as his categories settle.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861608254336663573" id="chatlog__message-container-861608254336663573"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 5:03 PM">5:03 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Yet,” Guilherme put emphasis on the word.  “Each major occasion has left me confident and comfortable in my assertion that it could have been done better, or that she had other goals in mind.  Always insufficient in some way, always subversive, always in ways that test Kennet.  She arranged the final blow to the Witch Hunter, but she guided him toward our more vulnerable Others before that.  Many were hurt, including Nibble and Chloe, and several goblins were killed.  She was wounded trying to stop the glamour-drowned Daniel Alitzer, but I’m of the belief she did this to drop into the background and withdraw her aid, letting her ideological opponents within Kennet’s council do the fighting and tire themselves out, while she maneuvered-”

“I take it you vote for exile?” Toadswallow asked.

Guilherme held up a hand, which made Toadswallow frown, annoyed.  “What comes next is relevant.  A man of unnatural beauty was spotted by Lis, having bystanders do the task of filling up his car and paying for his gas.  The beauty came from a place outside of Lis’s reach, impossible to emulate, so Lis went to Maricica for assistance, Maricica turned the man away.  I do not think this man is gone.”</code>There is also, of course, the concern that he's going to take up the entire meeting and nothing will get done.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861608949924364299" id="chatlog__message-container-861608949924364299"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 5:06 PM">5:06 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Which would probably be his purpose in doing so.

“Not a Fae.  Some practitioners turn their talents toward refining their selves.  Some do it for longevity, as Matthew’s father did, but others do it for other advantages.  Matthew might know more than I do.”

“We’re getting sidetracked, you oaf,” Toadswallow said.  “The longer you go on and on, the longer Maricica isn’t in exile.”</code>So we have two possibilities for what could go wrong here (there are more, but for the hypothetical there are two): either Guilherme means to stall the meeting, or he means to bait people into shutting them up. Toadswallow, of course, goes for the tactic I like to call Pussygull's Wager, which is that if you have two situations that could each go equally horribly wrong, then the one where the faerie gets to fill your ears with less glitter glue is probably the worse one. Pussygull didn't consider the idea that that's exactly what they want you to think. Toadswallow does consider that idea, but doesn't give a shit. And maybe he's right. After all, if Guilherme is never actually going to <em>get</em> to the point and we'll be fucked either way, then better to shut him up early.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861613407413338172" id="chatlog__message-container-861613407413338172"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><img alt="Avatar" class="chatlog__avatar" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/373003103592775681/25f8c0504857856378004bc80466e218.png?size=512"/></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="373003103592775681" title="lapsedclassicist">Lapsed Classicist</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 5:24 PM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-861613407413338172">7/5/2021 5:24 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">The truth actually is that Guilherme's descent to Winter just means he becomes an annoying NPC in a videogame cutscene you cannot skip.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861613480176254977" id="chatlog__message-container-861613480176254977"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><img alt="Avatar" class="chatlog__avatar" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/325480568307449867/449d7ef9226ffdff029ce5b8e2bc41d4.png?size=512"/></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="325480568307449867" style="color:rgb(238,221,136)" title="jaymaniac">JayManiac</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 5:24 PM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-861613480176254977">7/5/2021 5:24 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">....yeah pretty much</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861613497095684096" id="chatlog__message-container-861613497095684096"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 5:24 PM">5:24 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Please,” Toadswallow said, like he hadn’t been contributing as much disruption as Guilherme.</code>And yeah it takes about a minute of Guilherme pulling his bullshit before Toadswallow loses the 'composed, compassionate, serious leader' part.

“There’s a tell.  I asked the woman, she comes into my store sometimes, she helped build the addition where we have kayaks and canoes, did she think he could have been a model?  She said he was too attractive to be a regular old model.  Those who find power or beauty or whatever else by practice or by their Other abilities often find innocent things put beyond their reach.  Politics, acting, work that would leverage those traits.  A man this beautiful could, I assume, become the husband of royalty and avoid most public events, existing more as rumor than reality, enjoying the luxury, but he could not easily find the public eye even if he sought it.  Sometimes their beauty is captured in the moment but it curdles in retrospect, sometimes it’s something more specific, like being the opposite of photogenic, appearing ugly in photos and videos.  These things hold them back when circumstances alone aren’t enough to.  In much the same way, a Heartless practitioner that achieves immortality may find that any fortunes tied directly to them age in a way they don’t.  Those fortunes will slip away from them if they have to withstand any scrutiny from innocents.  Heartless will tend to put their fortunes into art collections and obscure ventures.”</code>Okay, no, I <em>did</em> misunderstand, that's not what happened at all.

“More than you’ve put up with others,” Miss said.  “I know she’s shopped on your behalf when you were preoccupied with other matters, and she requested that you purchase a splinter of abyssal wood, which you did, and you were paid for the delivery with a curse that you used to empower one of your creations.”

I’m so not in a mood for goblin and faerie hijinks right now, Lucy thought, thumbs hooked into her pockets, hands balling up into fists.</code>I haven't been pulling out a lot of the Lucy moments because she's mostly on the same page as the audience here, but I <em>am</em> excited to see how exactly she makes these opinions known, because it's a building source of tension. I wonder if she <em>is</em> going to bottle it up until she snaps, and whether that'll be worse than if she'd spoken up immediately? Always possible. It also looks fairly likely that Toadswallow was the one who provided all the goblin traps for the conspiracy. Those exchanges aren't evident here, but Miss could've already been absent for them. Which would be great, because it would mean that there <em>maybe</em> aren't any goblins involved.

“Hharrumph,” Toadswallow grunted out the sound.

“I have to ask,” Miss said.</code>Yeah, Toadswallow really doesn't advertise his relationships with faerie though, so I wonder how the goblin posse is going to take it? Tatty seems...supportive? Eh, this isn't <em>that</em> new of a revelation to lots of people though, it's by no means the Big Reveal of his Eighth Market ideology, though it skirts that area.

“As I can testify.” Guilherme’s voice was dry, idly amused.

Guilherme agreeing with Toadswallow hurt more than it helped, as far as the various goblins and their upset went.  It felt like another second of delay when Lucy wanted to be gone already, already talking to her mom.</code>I love these two so much.

All eyes were on her.

She was tired, upset, she was sore from running around, and she was sweaty.  Her mom had been threatened and she still hadn’t gotten the full story.

“Please… can we move this along?  I want to check on my mom,” she told the assembly, trying to keep her voice level.

“Any further input that is especially relevant?” Toadswallow asked, grumpy.  “No?  Then we’ll vote.  One by one, state your names clearly, your nature, and your vote clearly.  I, Sir Toadswallow, goblin, vote for exile.”</code>I hope this does get rewarded, because I count it as a point in Lucy's favor that she remains calm while still making her point and setting that boundary for herself.

“I do,” Toadswallow said.  “But that’s focused on the outside.  Inside, the wraiths and spirits keep appearing.  Sometimes it’s easier to push the innocents indoors and churn up the immaterial landscape.”

“You are the head of Kennet,” Miss said.  “If that’s your decision-”

“It’s not,” Toadswallow said.  “But be aware.  We’ll all have to work harder to keep the town safe.”

There were nods of heads and agreements.  Lucy couldn’t help but notice the new Others were a little less sure.

She was leader of the town before, but it was an unofficial position because it was the way things had naturally fallen into place.

Lucy kind of consistently misreads Verona's motivations, even though she's great at figuring out Verona's behavior.

It's a story we hear in neurodiverse communities (particularly autistic communities) all the time: the neurodiverse person is perceived as not caring, not being emotional, not prioritizing their friends and connections, when really those things are all that they're thinking about.
2. Lucy...doesn't seem to have the best sense of how Verona has grown over the course of the story. She's interested in Practice, sure, but that interest is no longer enough to <em>pilot</em> her through learning and getting more powerful and taking responsibility.

I think that's actually a real clicking point for me when it comes to the themes that Pale is exploring. Obviously Pale is about this greater social injustice that we can't always fight against, it's about these grand ideas of justice. But it's also, like Verona has said, a bunch of little games with their own rules. Every time and every context that you associate with other people, you are building a miniature society, a little <em>world</em> right there. It carries a lot in from the Real World as prescribed by society at large, and no problem exists in isolation of that, but it <em>is</em> your own little world. And a lot of Pale is about how various rule structures and societal structures rub up against each other in unproductive ways. All of Faerie is oppressed and kept under by the mundane world and specifically christianity, so it gets more competitive and cutthroat in order to get by. The Brownies drag people away, Faerie who aren't 'worth' their salt are disposed of. It's a toxic relationship within that society, <em>because</em> of the greater context.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861647997996367882" id="chatlog__message-container-861647997996367882"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 7:41 PM">7:41 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">In this case, Jas' advice and rules and reliance on systems of power that don't affect Others can't help.

1. Parenting someone with executive functioning issues is tough, because they don't tend to associate punishments as consequences for their actions, especially when those actions occur in different 'worlds'. They see the cause/effect of it, but it doesn't click. A NT kid might see that X thing happened because of Y action, but someone with ED might come to the conclusion that X thing happened because parent <em>found out</em> about Y action, for example. This disconnect between how the caregiver is looking at the situation and how the kid is seeing it can lead to...well, the kid not 'answering the question as intended', to put it in the terms of the bio test. They might figure out the system and try to perform well enough that they avoid the consequences. This link is because the school system is practically a codification of parenting tactics that sure as fuck don't work for everyone.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861659414284337203" id="chatlog__message-container-861659414284337203"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 8:26 PM">8:26 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">2. Those kinds of techniques have never or rarely been used in parenting Verona, and certainly haven't been used effectively. She'd be building the link between punishments and bad behavior from <em>scratch</em> because it's not a thing she's used to. So even if they <em>would</em> work if administered properly to someone with Executive Dysfuction throughout their entire childhood (I'm thinking of her 'hangover work', building that association between what you did and what happened) Verona is going to struggle to think like that.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="861659495763935253" id="chatlog__message-container-861659495763935253"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Monday, July 5, 2021 8:27 PM">8:27 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Curfew in strict effect, and it has to be a group date.

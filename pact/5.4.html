The walls were falling away.  Not fading, not collapsing… they were already hard to make out, dark in a room lit only by the glimmers of ghosts.  Light snow fell on Evan’s side, rain and wind on mine.  Shadows congealed into trees behind him, dark, barely lit by the moon.  Leaves were falling along with the snow.

Also that makes Pauz of the fifth choir "choir of the feral" which makes a lot of sense. I like that we get all these, and kinda want to go back to other places choirs have been mentioned, like black lambs blood, to see what those were specifically. I also wonder if there's a meaningful difference between demons and devils. they've been using the terms interchangably, and so have I, but maybe there's something more? I dunno, my friends are trying to get me into pathfinder and there's a big difference there</span>

But we don’t know where demons come from, but they exist as a sort of counterpoint to the forces of creation, civilization, growth, and order.  The choirs aren’t real things… only an idea that some have clung to, some demons and devils included.  They’re a handy way of categorizing.”

“A dangerous way of categorizing,” I said.  “Like calling something a goblin, when it could be something else entirely.  You prepare to deal with a goblin, and you get surprised.”

“Yes.”</div> I mean, that's what granny rose was all about! But it's cool to mention that demons and devils themselves have clung to the ideas, thus giving them some meaning. Something becomes a "real thing" in pact when the people or Others involved believe it is, so...they kind of <em>are</em> a real thing, just not real enough that you can make assumptions based on it</span>

I want to figure out the underlying rules, so I keep reading, I keep hitting the books.  If we can figure out the internal logic of this world, we can start to nail some things down.  I don’t like the Others that straddle or ignore categories.  Especially the scary, demon-tier Others.”

“My view on it,” I said, “Is that there aren’t hard and fast rules.  This isn’t a science, exactly.  It’s not like math, where you can decode it and figure out the system.  It’s more like English class.  Or art theory.  You interpret, you divine the symbols and commonalities, you inject your own voice, views, and apply your own labels and rules, given the chance.  Math is just there, waiting to be discovered.  With English, with art, you can forge your own way.”</div></span>

Virtually every creation myth touches on certain key ideas.  Light is the most common.  The sun, fire, something in that vein, it’s intrinsically linked to creation in the human consciousness.  To the birth of the universe, the planet, society, and other things.  Water and earth tend to follow in general popularity, but those aren’t choirs we need to focus on.”

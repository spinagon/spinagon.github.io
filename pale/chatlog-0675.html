They hadn’t hunted.  Some had hid, some hadn’t been anywhere near this.  But the fire burned, the pack of darts, as she thought of them, had been stripped of outer layers, their flesh no longer rippling and shuffling, settling into a case of being just meat.  The little raptor-things, fast as hell, had been corralled by her group, steered toward a cliff, and, turning on people, ready to start fighting back, they’d been caught in the periodic venting of smoke.  The ones who hadn’t suffocated trying and failing to blindly climb the wall had come stumbling out of the smoke, into waiting spearpoints.

Thirty sleek little reptile-mammal bodies for twenty people, now roasting at the ends of those spearpoints, bled out, skinned, vitals removed.

Except another fifteen people had come out of the shadows after.  A good few of them were members of one tribe.  Lucy wanted them.  More people, more resources.  She’d insisted they stay.  They’d contribute after.  It hadn’t gone over well.  Some people had left, taking food with.</code>We saw Verona's first ovetures at alliance go badly too, but that was just one person rather than an already established community. I <em>am</em> glad we get to take a look at what Lucy's version of the first length was like, because I suppose I hadn't considered all of what it meant that she rolled up mostly relying on the Dogs of War.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162324998602641418" id="chatlog__message-container-1162324998602641418"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 12:44 PM">12:44 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">She had her flaws. She’d thought she was conquering them.

“You’re not real.  Born to mothers and fathers, human, sure, you have your histories, fine.  But you’re not real.”

Strip away the outer layer, though?  Take away the clothes, take away personal grooming, take away the reputation she’d cultivated and earned, fighting her ass off, starting her over again?  Take away words, in this setting, where she couldn’t string a few together?</code>Okay, so we're getting little snippets of the present, almost like this is an extended flashback while the rest of the story marches on. Taking Lucy back to the first phase of the Crucible, where she was stripped of every coping mechanism she's built over the course of the story. Also makes you realize how much of Lucy's coping <em>is</em> about having built her own identity like this. I feel like as many epithets as Verona collects, her identity and self-esteem takes less of a blow from starting over in a new environment. Just goes to show that all healing and all coping is contextual to some degree, and that's <em>usually</em> okay.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162325834749706330" id="chatlog__message-container-1162325834749706330"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 12:47 PM">12:47 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">There was another raid before the evening, both groups larger.  It felt less like there was a point now beside the hate, the vendetta.  They’d made destroying Lucy’s group a part of who they were, now.  Lucy, wearing a warped fox skull over her head, couldn’t fight as much as she wanted.

Couldn’t do more than sit back and watch as her firstborn son died, rammed through with a spear that ended him in that same moment.</code>It's startling what a contrast this is from Verona's run through of the Crucible, much more focus on human/human conflict than on human/monster conflict, which makes more sense the more I think about it. Lucy's central themes tying in with the realities of war- heck, this conflict might be a prerequisite for the Dogs' emergence. This also reminds me of Lucy's run of the Musser contest, how she became a Rapacious Practitioner. Always drawn to war and conflict with other people.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162326304708890667" id="chatlog__message-container-1162326304708890667"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 12:49 PM">12:49 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Late in the evening, her eyes opened.  She was her newborn, now a year or so old.  She sat at a distance, gazing past the fire and its smoke, across their shelter -close grown trees by a cliff face, with some water running down the cliff- at her body, with her face, which, as life left it, had what was so often called ‘resting bitch face’ lose its ‘bitch’ part, the perpetual frown, and found only the resting part, instead.

Experiencing that, seeing that, it made a feeling swell inside her that felt bigger than she was.  As if she’d been stabbed by a spear that grew into a tree trunk, and the tree trunk got bigger than she was.  The sight of herself at peace, dead in another sort of battle, lying in blood.  The experience of it.  Those moments of bleeding out, and the fear.

She’d remember that if she ever had a second child.</code>Lucy also just feels the themes and scenarios of this contest hit her a lot harder than Verona. What Verona was emotionally affected by here was a literal peak behind the veil, noticing that Mal and Anselm were part of the Crucible's composition, but Lucy is seeing the intergenerational trauma and its parallels with her own life, immersing herself in the experience.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162326658859143258" id="chatlog__message-container-1162326658859143258"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 12:51 PM">12:51 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">The one in the lead closed the distance in a single stride, and gripped her wrist, fierce.  Stopping her.

She was tense- aware that he was dangerous.  More dangerous than a Dog of War from the modern day.  Touching that blood again, she reached out, and touched the red streak that ran from forehead to chin, down neck to mid-chest.  Power, from me to you.  Basic, primitive practice.

It might have been a shift of clouds and smoke overhead, a movement of leafless tree branches, but it felt like the red of that blood became redder.  Did he stand a little taller?

He took more meat, and held it out and to the side, for his allies to take.  Blood-streaked.  Dogs of War, from before a time when that was their name.</code>But just like Verona she finds her Other kin here, builds a relationship with them. Having won their existence through conflict and sacrifice</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162327862284660788" id="chatlog__message-container-1162327862284660788"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 12:55 PM">12:55 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">This was the challenge, then.  Something generational.  She’d become her child.  She’d fight, struggle, become her grandchild.

Could she hold onto who she was, through that process?  It wasn’t just the idea she might lose herself in all of this, but the further she moved from ‘herself’, the less some of her lessons from Guilherme and Bubbleyum would apply.  If becoming someone new meant her defensive walls came down… that could make the difference when hunting a primeval.

The partners she chose, the child she raised, the ways she shaped things, the decisions she made, even the expressions she chose and way she held herself, they defined her in turn.</code>It's so interesting to see how differently Lucy processes this challenge, how much more <em>vulnerable</em> her Self and her accumulated self-worth are in face of something which changes the fundamentals of her identity.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162328105088712736" id="chatlog__message-container-1162328105088712736"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 12:56 PM">12:56 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Which is also being piled on top of Charles' batshit assertion that she's not real</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162328310953554011" id="chatlog__message-container-1162328310953554011"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 12:57 PM">12:57 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">I hope things can at least start to get better for her once she's back in her own body with Avery and Verona around to be anchors of reality around her.

Even if we’re less real, karma owning more of what we do, hmm… how do I say it?  It’s kinda been a warning right from the beginning, you know?  The diagram to Awaken is celestial but a bit argumentative too- it’s a thing to call in, hmm… outside power.  Or go to outside power.”

“Summon this, tap so-and-so for power, open a door to some Path or Ruins place.”

“Yes, thanks Ronnie.  But like, the way I think about it.  Right from that moment, it’s like pow, now you’re a little Other.  And the trajectory in my head is like… being Aware, or picking up more rituals, or doing more practice, it pushes you away from everything Innocent, everything distinctly human.  And if you push far enough away, if you lose touch with who you are-“

“You become Lost.”

“Or Abyssal.”</code>I like the framing of the Awakening Ritual as Argumentative in the same way that- for example -Sheridan's losing diagram was Argumentative, because I feel like that's always how I've conceptualized it. It's a statement to the world, to the spirits, that you're now a <em>character</em> in this unfolding story, with spiritual associations that can be drawn upon to organize the universe around you. But Avery's also framing it here as a sort of summoning, conducted by Kennet to bring the stars into alignment, to metaphysically associate the girls with the mystery of the Carmine Beast's death.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162330233022730290" id="chatlog__message-container-1162330233022730290"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 1:05 PM">1:05 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“It’s not that, so much.

I don’t like being diminished, I don’t like not getting credit, or people looking past me.  Same way you get bugged by being ignored, Ave.”

“Yeah.”

“Or you, I don’t know, Ronnie.  It’s the same for you?  Not getting credit, not being heard, not having an impact?  Whether it’s chores for your dad or the extra effort at school, or…?”

“Or talking to my mom, sometimes.  It’s all the same thing, Luce.  Same thing, different angles.”

“Distilled down to ‘not real’, or ‘not legit’?  Fuck him.  Fuck this.  But like… fuck, how much of what we are is owed to karma, now?  Because I don’t like any answer that isn’t zero percent, and I don’t think it’s zero.”</code>And like...I don't know. I understand completely <em>why</em> this would bother Lucy, but I don't know how avoidable it is? Somehow I didn't have 'the characters are forced to grapple with the fact that they are characters in an unfolding epic' on my bingo card but boy am I here for it. I guess a part of why this bugs Lucy is probably because she's built her identity and reputation off of having earned her accomplishments. She doesn't want to think about how she still had karma on her side, even in her worst moments, because she's seen the injustice of that system.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162330648854409226" id="chatlog__message-container-1162330648854409226"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 1:07 PM">1:07 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">But isn't it also just...grappling with the idea of privilege?

Green and wheat?  If wheat was beige-y, his clothing with deeper green accents.  He was definitely Verona’s type.  Skinnier, languid.  He had light brown skin, slight bags under his eyes, and thick black hair with the sort of waves that had to be hell to tame, twists going this way and that.  He was with what looked like family.

He reminded Lucy of Tymon.  That sleepy, easygoing look, the untamed hair from when Tymon had had bedhead- very Greek in Tymon’s part, while this guy looked a bit more Middle Eastern.

“Are we talking guys now?” Lucy asked.

“I noticed him on a past visit.  He has a mark under his bracelets.  Like mine.”

The guy wore a mess of bracelets and beaded accessories around his forearms.  Kind of like Avery.</code>Not sure when it happened at the beginning of the book, but this moment also has its parallel. Verona noticing a guy worthy of attention, pointing him out to Lucy.

“I don’t fight like that, Luce,” Verona said.  “I’d say go for it.  You find your bone-to-keep-at-home.  I’ll admire him from an artistic point of view, and if you ever opened up the relationship, or wanted to bring in a third for something experimental, I wouldn’t say no to seeing what’s beneath the wheat and green outfit.”

Verona cackled.

Something she’d lost with Anselm and Mal, in different ways, Lucy supposed.

When would this melancholy stop dwelling so heavily in Lucy?  Ever since she’d seen her own older corpse, after a death in childbirth, it had sat large inside her, a lot of feelings tied into it.

A lot of baggage thrown in with the ‘not real’ bullshit.

She wanted, needed to hold onto her Self here, in this weird landscape.</code>I really like that this book is taking some time to methodically explore the different psychological reactions to the Crucible. Because there's a sense in which the Kenneteers have seen it all at this point- and that's what Verona sort of experiences in her chapter, not as affected by the contest itself as by what's behind it -but it's also a deeply surreal and uncomfortable experience.

She trailed off as she realized Miss had appeared, in the same moment she’d said the name.

“…what you told us, Miss, when we were heading from Kennet to the Blue Heron, after the Aware attacked.  The stories about Others.  How things developed, before and during the Seal.”

“I knew him, not a long time ago, a short time ago, or a time in the future, here, but a sideways time distant,” Miss said.  “What I’ve said to you was said before, to ears once beside and preceding your own.”

“Right,” Lucy murmured.  “Shared your thoughts and knowledge with him before us?”

“As he was before you.”

“You guys think he used that to build this dynamic and situation?” Avery asked.

“Or inspire it,” Verona said.  “If you need to paint an interpretation of history, you use the references you’ve got, and he had Miss.”</code>I wonder to what degree Miss- intentionally or otherwise -provided an avenue for Charles' radicalization?

The Inquisitors could practice, but they weren’t alone.

For Lucy, Verona, and Avery, too.  The inquisitors between them and the inside of the city had backs turned.  People, some unassuming, like old men or pregnant women, pushed forward through a crowd that had stopped marching forward, Lucy, Avery, and Verona with them.

Inquisitors were attacked, near-simultaneously.  Pulled off their feet.  Mobbed by people, one person devoting themselves to just holding onto an arm that gripped a weapon, while another covered face and head.

Some locals tried to stop the people attacking inquisitors.

The inquisitors were rallying, and they were strong, but their power came from gods, and godly power came from worship.  In this era, in this sort of environment, a lot of the gods were singular, local to an area.  So the god of sand, light, and sound didn’t have much reach.

I think about the expression on my mom’s face when my stepdad left, that heartbreak, and I see it when I tell her I have to be here to stop you from all of this.  That’s as much your fault as it was mine.  You made decisions here, Charles.”

“I thought it would be interesting, to do with you what you did with Musser.  If I made you live my life, how many choices would you really have?”

“I lived my life, and I wouldn’t fucking choose to kill John.  I wouldn’t keep quiet about the Choir.”</code>Like, I don't know if Lucy's entirely being fair here, she <em>does</em> dodge this question because it threatens to poke at that 'not real' button she's decided to ignore.

It gave people pause, at first- the way this worked, there was no internet to coordinate, only word of mouth, sometimes only a few sentences, or a partial instruction.  So not everyone knew.

It became clear pretty quickly that the Others were on their side.

The inquisitors were rallying, and they were strong, but their power came from gods, and godly power came from worship.  In this era, in this sort of environment, a lot of the gods were singular, local to an area.  So the god of sand, light, and sound didn’t have much reach.

Opposite to worship was condemnation.  An angry crowd speaking out against a god diminished it.</code>So if the Crucible is made of glamour, then all these gods are basically faerie anyways.

“Maybe,” he said.  “If Kennet’s gone and the region resettles, when practitioners have moved on, who’s going to remember you, Lucy Ellingson?  What would you be, besides maybe a girl someone went to school with once?  Avery Kelly can be remembered as a girl who burned bright and burned out fast, wiped away.  Remembered by some older Garricks.

“Trying to twist that ‘you’re not real’ knife?” Lucy asked.

He raised one eyebrow, his voice a growl, “strikes me that you won’t be remembered for much more than having been my enemy."</code>Yeah, he'd sure like to think that. And in terms of the larger practitioner community- the internationals and such -<em>maybe</em> he has a bit of a point. The Kenneteers are known for being the ones to oppose Charles, the practitioners responsible for bringing him to justice. But that won't be in the top ten things Toadswallow remembers about them.

He threw Gashwad sideways through a window, then coughed a few more times.

“Charles?”

The voice was soft.

Charles’ response was a breath with a bit of rasp and gurgle to it.

The Aurum.</code>It's so much fun that the Aurum calls him Charles, rather than Carmine here. I even went back to Ryan's chapter to see if that was consistent with how he thinks of Charles and it's not. It's a beckoning, a manipulation here, a false reassurance of friendship and collaboaration. After all, we know how Ryan treats his friends and collaborators.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1162369949117984859" id="chatlog__message-container-1162369949117984859"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Friday, October 13, 2023 3:43 PM">3:43 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“If it spits out a winner, I’ll let it,” the Aurum said.

The quiet manor burbled with faint conversation on other floors and other rooms.  Laughter.  Past the window, it ceased to be dark, the paths lit up by lamps.  Occupied by some scattered, strange Others and practitioners.

Charles managed to straighten, smiling.  He spread his hands.

“Plan remains the plan,” Lucy said.  The world beyond the window bloomed with light and new life.  Fae were coming in through the front gates, into an open entrance garden with waiting family members.  Lucy focused her gaze on Charles.

She saw his expression change, in response to the words and the steady gaze.

“Keep Charles down.  We deal with what comes.”</code>Of course the Allaires and the Faerie would make their mark on some aspect of the crucible, let this new 'paragon' try their hand at some definitions, some delightful new aspect of story.

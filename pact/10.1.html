“Absolutes are pretty fucking damning,” I said.

“Then I’ll be damned,” Rose told me.  “Because the alternative is worse.  There’s a war going on, and there’s no room for mistakes.”</div>I didn't know what to pull so I just pulled the whole thing because there's <em>so much here</em>. Rose is the reductionist, the absolutist, and there are <em>really good reasons why</em>, but we also know how dangerous that can be. We've spent so many stories coming face to face with the gray, so going back to black and white pisses us- pisses <em>me</em> right the fuck off. Wasn't this the problem with the Behaims? That they built a narrative of absolutes when it came to diabolism, and so they could <em>never ever</em> deal with the Thorburns or give them slack? And we see Rose following so steadfast in these footsteps, we see the cycle just spinning, round and round and round.</span>

Rose doesn't have many allies to summon because no one likes her, Behaims might have some people elsewhere like Duncan, stationed in particularly interesting places, and Duchamps just brought a <s>harem</s> cult to help out, so things are getting pretty intense.

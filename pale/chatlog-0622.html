Okay.

There was laughter around the fire.  Lucy couldn’t help but worry she was intruding on a dynamic if she approached.  She was a teenager, she knew some of them liked to tell jokes that her mom wouldn’t be okay with.</code>I like how the phone call bridges the gap between this and the last chapter, passing the narrative along with a good transition. We haven't exactly caught up with Lucy in a while but I'm very interested in her reaction to what Jas orchestrated (given that she wasn't particularly keen on it last we checked) and how this chapter is going to think through the questions that Jas was wrestling with.

“I can bribe the others for help,” Midas said.  “Foggy?”

“I’ll help,” Foggy said.

“I didn’t even tell you what the bribe was.”

“Oh.”

Foggy wasn’t too bright.</code>Midas still seems to be...maybe not having <em>trouble</em> fitting in, because this is sorta just part of the dynamic, but he certainly still seems pissed off.

“-and he’s unpacking stuff, Dog Tag stuff, came with the kit he was given, gifted by War herself-”

The sound of a gunshot made Lucy jump out of her skin.

Pipes wheezed.  Blood pumped out of a hole in his chest.  Lucy tensed, watching carefully.

“Midas,” Horseman said.  “Pipes is still healing, damn it.”</code>Fucking shit. I mean it seems like if Midas was looking for fights, Pipes was all too happy to give him one, but gods damn it that's still not okay.

Midas stared at him.

“Yeah?” Horseman asked.

“Yeah,” Midas said.  He sat.

Lucy glanced at Grandfather, who was stirring a pot of soup that hung from a wire and rod setup at the edge of the fire.  He watched, quiet.  She’d kind of pegged Grandfather as more of a leader, but in situations like this, or in direct combat, Horseman seemed to step up more.</code>I don't think Grandfather is usually the leader. He's got the most experience as an existing person maybe but he's always sort of resisted leader-ish roles and I don't think he thinks of himself as the leader except in very specific situations, despite theoretically having the most experience. He was just, you know. Closest to John and Yalda. Spent the most time with him as far as we know.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083051661150392430" id="chatlog__message-container-1083051661150392430"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 6:40 PM">6:40 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Seat still warm?” Grandfather asked, unsurprised.

“He took it with him, but…” Angel touched the log.  “Yes.”

“I can,” Lucy offered.

“No,” Grandfather said.  “From the way this was described to me, you’re meant to be going to the Sable.  They might be aiming to interrupt it so let’s avoid giving them the chance.”

Lucy frowned.

“Mark?” Grandfather asked.</code>Sensible- she's the most important target here -but alienating when Lucy wants to share in the camraderie and the workload. Being treated with special care isn't what she wants. Interestingly, I think Grandfather and Jas might agree about whose daughter they want Lucy to be.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083053299319705661" id="chatlog__message-container-1083053299319705661"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 6:47 PM">6:47 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“So this dog tag, who shall remain nameless-”

“We know it’s Midas,” Angel said.

“-who shall remain nameless, throws the thing away.  So naturally I dig it out of the trash to look at what it is.  And what do we have?  We’ve got a hardcore living spirit, an animus, out in snowy Quetta, assigned by War herself to this conflict, outfitted, armed, and given grit.  And part of that outfitting from War, for whatever reason, she saw fit to have him accidentally pack a breast pump from his nonexistent wife back home.”

There were some light chuckles, Pipes’ laugh was loudest of all.

“That’s sweet though,” Grandfather said, eyes on the fire.  “We carry things from people.  Killed in war, killing themselves, getting killed.  Some get killed by us.  And I think it’s a good thing, that you’re carrying something like that inside you.  Preserving it.”</code>Grandfather has this moment of more quiet de-escalation, not dealing with an immediate conflict like a leader, just trying to provide the team some more stability from the back lines.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083053694209237052" id="chatlog__message-container-1083053694209237052"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 6:48 PM">6:48 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">She went on, “And I guess broader… Kennet-side dynamics.

She paused, searching for a way to phrase it that straddled both the actual plan and the plan that had them doing a follow-up attack.  She looked up, and the feel of the group had changed slightly, enough that the one pause became two.

The silence felt a little too pointed.

She dropped her eyes to the bread.  “-the one big attempt, I guess?”

“You guys talk, keep yourselves occupied,” Grandfather told the others.  He used a stick to pick up the wire fixture that the soup pot dangled from, and walked over to plunk himself down on the same log Lucy sat on.  Horseman scooched over.</code>And this is absolutely the big thing she's been dwelling on, beyond her own dynamic with the Dog Tags. Trying to make sense of. I wonder how it might be different if she knew about Jas' role in it. If Verona had told her, and she'd been able to get the details out. Because part of what's happening here is that she senses that it's out of character, just a little.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083054492615987261" id="chatlog__message-container-1083054492615987261"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 6:51 PM">6:51 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“There’s a limit to how much war anyone should see,” Horseman said.  “Especially the young.  It gets too ugly.  Changes you.”

He said that while looking a lot like a sixteen year old.  As close to being her age as he was to being Booker’s.

“What if it should change you?” Lucy asked.  “What if… what if there’s a lot that’s wrong in the world, and if the really fucked up thing is how blind and complacent and distracted they all are?  Your average person.  I’m not talking about practice stuff only, either.  It’s people not caring about politics, or not even respecting attempts at trying for change, or recognizing what a lot of people are dealing with on a day to day basis?  How many people out there don’t get it?  Don’t even try to get it?  Understanding the other sides?”</code>It's honorable that they're kind of choosing protecting Lucy over making sure they get their revenge here. At least in the short term.

He trailed off.

“Not to what?” Lucy asked.

Grandfather shifted his position, then stirred the soup, metal spoon scraping against metal as he got the bits that were sticking to the bottom.  “I wonder if he got there in the end.  Or got close.  You’re saying people are complacent, and, what, it’s better that people like you are being sent off to war, fighting for a cause, than to be complacent, no fight in you at all?”

“Considering what’s going on in the world?  Not just Others being bound, or racism, but… fuck.  Poverty, class divides, gender divides- the fact that me and all my female friends have gotten looks and gross comments from men old enough to be our dads.  Yeah.  And then guys don’t get that?  Every boy I tell it to acts surprised or gives a vibe like they don’t believe me.  It’s all like that, all a fight to get people to even accept there is a different side to understand, let alone get them over onto your side.  Or it’s a fight to stop the problem at its source.  Then if you don’t fight it, what are you condoning?”

“Let me turn that around on you,” Grandfather said.  “If you’re always fighting it, when do you enjoy the good parts?  What are you fighting for, if there’s always going to be another fight?”</code>I do think this conversation is going to be better for Lucy than any conversation with her mom about this. If she's going to be okay with potentially giving up the fight, she's going to have to hear about it from the people who can't. I still don't think it's going to happen. I don't think she's going to just sit down and accept it at the end of this, if their attempt fails.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083056878600323212" id="chatlog__message-container-1083056878600323212"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 7:01 PM">7:01 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Next generation springs up.

The good and safe places need to be protected extra because of the sacrifices of your generation.  So the next generation, your kids, they carry on the fight.  And they keep the good moments squeezed in between the fights, while you and all the immortals who’ve been watching the trends see them wearing down, wearing out, getting bloody.”

“And the next generation takes the same approach I’m suggesting?” Lucy asked.

“Yeah.  And maybe there’s a big, multi-generational setback.  One big fight gets lost, something else.  If that happens every few generations, that’s a good recipe for a forever-war.  Hell of a way to be, if nobody gets to be fat and happy and ignorant, if nobody gets to be complacent.  If everyone’s wedging in the narrow good moments between the exhausting hell of fighting forces and realities as big as the whole damn planet.”</code>And these are questions that I really don't have answers to, even if I believe in the change that Kennet is making. There are <em>always</em> going to be bigger threats than you can possibly deal with, and so to what degree is a single person obligated to keep fighting? It's gotta be a balance between throwing yourself entirely into that life and never letting up, and resigning yourself to complete apathy like Eloise has.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083057882301485138" id="chatlog__message-container-1083057882301485138"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 7:05 PM">7:05 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">For Horseman, it was a bit of that bone-deep weariness.

“Rook’s… complicated,” Grandfather said.

“Sure.  Bad example.  Rook is weird.”</code>I mean Rook is a good example in some ways.

It’s like, especially after hearing this ultimatum about letting us have one more fight before we’re eighteen, hearing what you’re saying about me taking the opportunity to enjoy the… the fruits of past victories?”

“There’s a saying, I know I’m opening myself up to jokes saying it, but the world is great when old men plant trees they know they won’t sit in the shade of?  It’s sad if you’re spending all your time planting trees, then the next generation does the same, and that’s the dynamic forever.”

“That’s not the plan,” Lucy murmured.  “Even before that, the others and I were talking about when we quit, what it takes.  There’s a middle ground, where we’re not letting evil win- not letting the asshole who killed John and desecrated Yalda win, but still leaving room for life.”

“Sure,” Grandfather said.  “Speaking of.  Food, you need food to live, right?”

“Yeah.”

“Soup?”

“Sure.  Let me finish saying what I was saying, though?”</code>Which is probably one of a few reasons he kind of tries to derail this before Lucy can properly finish.  I do think the balance lies more on the side of stopping Charles first, but I don't even necessarily disagree that Lucy could let herself get consumed by the fight and need to take a step back.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083062481880105101" id="chatlog__message-container-1083062481880105101"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 7:23 PM">7:23 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Nah, I know.

You guys don’t have to fight forever either.  John got close to a peace and if he…”

She remembered the dog tags shifting as he bent down, his hands touching them.  The look in his eyes.  If he hadn’t, just then…

“…if things were slightly different, I think he could’ve had peace.  And without making too big a deal of it, I’m pretty sure I’d like a Dog Tag as a familiar.  So… I might not be equipped for a forever war, but you guys don’t have to be either.  I don’t think you need to be a familiar to find peace, but it sure would help.  That’s what I wanted to say.”

She glanced at Grandfather, then looked away, turning her focus back to the bread.  She moved the bread onto napkins, quickly daubing on some oily garlic butter and spooning on the bruschetta.

Neither Grandfather or Horseman were saying anything.  She’d brought up the familiar thing, then said something else, and now she wondered if they’d gotten the message.  She really didn’t want to make it a big deal, even if it was a big deal for her.</code>It's interesting that this is the route she goes when trying to get the Dog Tags to ease back on things, to accept more humanity. I'm still not sure what Grandfather would want there, and I don't think he'd want to settle into a place that was more rightly meant for John. Even if encouraged.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083063401967780001" id="chatlog__message-container-1083063401967780001"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 7:27 PM">7:27 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Don’t see myself doing that, sorry,” Horseman said.  “I wouldn’t know what to do with myself.”

Horseman nodded.

I didn’t figure you were up for it, she thought.  I’d really only take Horseman as a familiar if I was gearing up for that forever war, instead of nudging one of you in the other direction, off the battlefield.</code>Makes sense, yeah. Though I do wonder if there are other routes to change and readaptation for him. He picks up on practice stuff alright, he can organize goblins and probably fae-aligned Others, and there's still plenty to organize in times of peace. Plenty of violence to deal with even, taking the Undercity and the goblin market into account. But maybe he can find his way to a life that isn't <em>solely</em> war-focused even if war is an element. Or change the character of that element.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083064569515229265" id="chatlog__message-container-1083064569515229265"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 7:31 PM">7:31 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“I don’t even know,” Grandfather said.  “Maybe.

“Yeah.  From killing practitioners?” Lucy asked.

“We’ve got some odds and ends.  We had a talk before, about whether we should funnel certain kills to certain members of our group, or spread it out.  Needs to be human or human-like.  Not that we’ve been killing that many people.”

“Sure.”

“We got distracted by events.  Didn’t return to that talk.  But it’s been in the back of my mind.”

“I can look into some books and stuff.”

“Sure.”</code>Depends on how well rounded you want the group to be, I imagine. It could be nice to have those in leadership roles have a better grasp of the practice generally, if you've got a sting operation and need someone to take the shot. Probably better than spreading it out if I had to guess. And Horseman is adaptable and capable of being the one to make those kills, so I'd hedge towards getting him a good grounding first.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1083064913871781892" id="chatlog__message-container-1083064913871781892"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, March 8, 2023 7:33 PM">7:33 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“How do you eat this without making an ass of yourself?” Pipes asked, voice loud, using two hands to try to keep the toppings from tumbling off.

“Step one, don’t be an ass,” Lucy said, at the same time a few Dog Tags around the campfire said more or less the same thing.

There was some light laughter.  Pipes rolled his eyes, licking some fingers mostly clean of butter and oil.

Lucy eased up on the heavier topics, trying to find a few opportunities to joke around a bit.  It was easier, with the familiar topic raised and dropped without incident, and with her talking about how the dynamic was a bit hard to break into.  If Grandfather or Horseman were doing anything different, it was subtle enough she couldn’t tell if things improving was a her thing or a them thing.</code>I think it's probably just a matter of communication on both ends, seeing where people are at, and being able to trust yourself a bit more to engage with the dynamic without breaking something.

Midas stared at him.

“Yeah?” Horseman asked.

“Yeah,” Midas said.  He sat.

Lucy glanced at Grandfather, who was stirring a pot of soup that hung from a wire and rod setup at the edge of the fire.  He watched, quiet.  She’d kind of pegged Grandfather as more of a leader, but in situations like this, or in direct combat, Horseman seemed to step up more.</code>I don't think Grandfather is usually the leader. He's got the most experience as an existing person maybe but he's always sort of resisted leader-ish roles and I don't think he thinks of himself as the leader except in very specific situations, despite theoretically having the most experience. He was just, you know. Closest to John and Yalda. Spent the most time with him as far as we know. </span></div></div><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="330922971977875466" style="color:rgb(187,204,51)" title="zaximusq">A bird 🐦</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Thursday, March 9, 2023 5:51 AM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-1083220597951168512">3/9/2023 5:51 AM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">This got me thinking, I wonder if Grandfather has more than the average number of pieces of padres/chaplains/non specifically denominated spiritual guides in him.

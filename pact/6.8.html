If you are the Lord of a city, then your substance runs through that city.  This isn’t something you control, but is more incidental.

But at the same time… it’s obvious you’re bothered by what you’re seeing in the news, and the effects your contest are having on the public.  You’re wringing your hands-”</div> I'm sort of of two minds over all this too, and I'm glad Fell is; I never got the impression that he <em>cared</em> about the general residents of the city, <em>certainly</em> not in the way Blake does. It's nice to see that he appreciates Blake's...heartfulness, at least a little. Considering this is the same guy who double parks, no enchantment, just because of how little of a shit he gives. I mean, is it a worse crime than starting fires, crashes, and drunk rampages? No, but it's up there.</span>

There's no guarantee that deposing conquest would actually <em>help</em> the city in the long run, what with the instability that might cause, so Blake has to rely on the fact that he <em>is</em> helping Fell, Rose, and himself. That's...sorta selfish. But I don't know if <em>I</em> can stand to see conquest win, because of what that'll mean for Blake, so maybe...win at <em>most</em> costs? Try to minimize the damage while you've already got your hands full? This seems like a pretty diabolist situation here.</span>

Was there a flip side to that?  Was I weakening myself if I thrust myself into unfamiliar situations?

Was I weakened by the fact that Maggie was here, in my apartment, making me distinctly uncomfortable?</div> So I listened to DiP, and they pointed out that Maggie is probably hiding the whole prophesy thing, which might be why she's feeling a little bit off to Blake. It makes a lot of sense, I'd just forgotten that Blake didn't know about that. I mean yeah, with The Eye around fire and ruin seems pretty applicable. She might benefit from the city's turmoil, in that it might check one of her boxes for "you'll experience this again". I mean the stuff Blake was talking about on the news sounds like the beginnings of what we saw in Maggie's interlude. Let's just hope it doesn't progress much further.</span>

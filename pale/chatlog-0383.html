I still think he's different in that he <em>came</em> from innocence in a way that I don't feel happening here exactly- I don't see where that force comes through? -but at this point you've convinced me.
I still think that- while this <em>is</em> in some ways the point of knotted places, to have areas where the rules of the Seal are broken -it's still a bit surprising that the rules are breaking like this in ways that are so...accessible to practitioners? Like, sure the rules are fuzzy and it's 'locked off' from the rest of the world, but there's not a whole lot stopping the Bitter Street Witch from just fucking off now that she exists. Why don't we see <em>tons</em> of practitioners who used to be knotted people? Why haven't we seen any before? Is this kind of thing really <em>that</em> uncommon?- I feel like a version of it happens in a lot of major cities, and it seems like there would be practitioners like Bristow who are all <em>over</em> that. I suppose Bristow <em>was</em> kind of all over that. And maybe in the other knotted places there are simply overarching power structures and mechanisms of exploitation that generally prevent stuff like this from completely overtaking things. I do wonder if they're at a discount price in terms of accepting responsibility for them, because of their increased level of awareness and lack of 'place' in the world? 
Hey, with this knowledge at hand are the Kenneteers gonna Awaken Bracken or just let him keep being...well, a Kennet 'Other' somewhere between being an Other and being a sort of Witch-Hunter-esque Aware? Hey, considering that one of Guilherme's greatest 'errors' was bringing in the Witch Hunters only to have to fight them off, I'm going to say that counts as a poetic parallel to his hypothetical training of Bracken and thus is compatible with my theories.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="941058900780802088" id="chatlog__message-container-941058900780802088"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, February 9, 2022 10:52 PM">10:52 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Basic augury.

“Hmm.”

“Did you notice you got better results if you crushed the bird enough to get guts in the mix?”

“Mm.  I thought that was because there was more blood.”

Lucy walked away from the conversation, then eyed Verona, motioning for her to follow.

“I’ve heard and seen enough of him to know that’s true.  But I also know he’s a busy man who lets other priorities take hold, letting you down in occasions big and small.  If you want to trust him and it’s just you and your joy on the line, I’ll accept that,” Toadswallow said.  “But not if it’s a goblin I’ve said I’ll protect.  The little nubwit is apprenticed under me.  If he disappoints you, that’s one thing, but if, in the process of disappointing you, he puts her at risk, or if she gets lost and can’t find Kennet again, or if she gets hurt or bound-”

“I really think you’re wrong about Daddy.”

“-I can’t let that happen,” Toadswallow finished.</code>And here we see where the rift between Liberty and Toadswallow began (in all likelihood). Anthem represents a very real threat to Toadswallow and all of his kin, but Liberty isn't ready to lose faith in him just yet. Nor is Toadsy ready to push for it. I almost wonder if he was made to swear oaths, not to turn the Tedds against their father? It would make sense for Anthem to have him swear something like that at the outset, and it would make sense for why Toadswallow has- despite clearly caring for Liberty a lot -been so flippant about communicating why their relationship had to end. If he says 'bah, you can tell her or not tell her' to the Kenneteers, then he maintains plausible deniability and Anthem can't say that he intentionally told her the story to turn her against him. Just a thought, but it'd explain a few of the seeming inconsistencies in his behavior.
It's also really really sweet that despite whatever oaths he's made, he's not going to let Cherrypop get hurt. He's exactly the sort of gang leader she's always sort of wanted: someone who won't let her get seriously hurt, despite all the bullshit and slapstick antics.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="941060595623559188" id="chatlog__message-container-941060595623559188"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, February 9, 2022 10:58 PM">10:58 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“But you sure can be a real saggy butthole sometimes, you know that?”

“You abandoned us.  You got us to love you and then you abandoned us, and that’s a way meaner prank to pull than, like, a fire ant douche or brain damage.”

Verona glanced at Lucy, who had dropped her eyes to the ground.

“I did.  Had to.  I hope you understand there were good reasons.”</code>I'm not sure what would be more interesting either- Toadswallow swearing an oath and then having to stick to it and having to watch Liberty keep chasing after this idealistic image of her dad, or Toadswallow just not wanting to shatter that illusion for some other reason. I don't know exactly what that would be.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="941061528675819570" id="chatlog__message-container-941061528675819570"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, February 9, 2022 11:02 PM">11:02 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">I used to be her, Verona thought.

Maybe that was why Toadswallow wasn’t pushing harder.</code>Verona has a compelling potential answer, though.

Crawling around, through filth and muck, brave stray limb, it found deep inner strength… and knives!”

The part of the arm that would connect to a shoulder was raw, bristling with serrated objects and weaponry that scar tissue held in place.

They apparently just have Nico, Liberty, the goblins from around, and then the Undercitizens as potential buyers I think? Which is going to be interesting, I do wonder how Kennet plans to make the goblin market an essential phenomenon for the practitioner community at large- or if they're maybe trying to become so essential to the goblin community and Undercity that the goblins and Undercitizens would rise up in its defence if Kennet were to be attacked? Do they have plans to invite more Others and Practitioners? I would imagine so.

A justice of the peace- which she gathered was essentially a judge, and who earned a hundred and sixty thousand a year, from a quick search online.  She wasn’t sure if that was a lot, it seemed like a lot, but was it I have five boats of varying size a lot?

More importantly, they’d seemed chummy, and that had prompted Avery to look up the guy on her phone.  Snowdrop had listened in to catch his name, giving her a starting point.

The karmic push-forward idea is interesting, having something comparable to a Blackguard handling all the bits and bobs of the organization so that the spirits forget that it's handled by the practice.

Its head was human, or human-ish, without much of a nose, and with a toothless mouth.

looked up homunculi, then narrowed it down to ones that don’t move.  that looks like a styan.  which can sometimes move but usually not.

“What’s a-” Avery started to ask.  Verona had another message out before Avery could finish typing.

Verona:
styans are spying and anti-spying homunculi.  they give lots of false positives, pollute augury. sometimes people make them with their own blood and flesh to make it so anyone trying to track them tracks the styan too.

if you use clairvoyance or something and you see one, your practice can start screwing up and showing more styans, or the same one over and over.  they have mocking and weird faces because some say that helps make the pattern happen.</code>And it looks like this might be our opportunity to learn some of that more! I love that this is a bit of an elaboration on concepts we started exploring with Wye, in terms of giving lots of false positives and false 'eyes'.

She watched as the cool wind stirred the threads.

The ends of two cut threads nearly touched as they stretched between Willis and Tomas, as if the cut wasn’t there.  Others moved slightly as their targets did.

Willis got into his car.  Avery arranged the paper across the back of her phone, then cut the paper as best as she could.

This was a backwards improvisation.  The books the Garricks had given her had some stuff on working out paths, which included this thread trick, which was supposedly based on a means enchantresses like Eloise from the Blue Heron could use to to track people by their connections.  She didn’t have the enchantress method, but she could sort of work it out.</code>Oh <em>heck</em> yes!

Ever single other abused kid I've met said the single worst part of it, long term, was the self-blame and its knock-on effects.

“That lines up with something we heard,” Avery said.  From Bridge, who is possessing Musser’s man Basil.  “I won’t say the source, but we know Musser is dealing with Witch Hunters.  Supplying them, in exchange for a truce.  He wants it to be long-term.”

“Okay.  I don’t know anything about that, but the justice is being asked to help, as insurance.  They’re doing work for him for free, a lady he’s not married to is claiming they’re common law, he made promises to her, they’re going to make that go away.  And they’re paying him too.  He talked about buying a new thirty-six foot sailing vessel.  I would assume that’s expensive, but so many of you have these fancy cars.”</code>I guess that I always kind of assumed that the universe looking the other way was a big factor in how Witch Hunters and practitioners were able to get their hands on so much contraband and generally wreak havoc without legal consequence.

She moved the paper.  The threads adjusted.  Some took longer to adjust or figure out where they were meant to be than others.

“One’s rigid, like it’s being pulled super straight.  I think that might be his connection to home.  Home doesn’t move.

It's also always gratifying when people recognize how undeniably awesome the Kenneteers are, and give them chances to reflect on how much they've grown.

The way things were set up now, they only came into town a couple of times a week, usually to resupply, touch base, and meet family obligations.  Three of their kids, two ten year olds and an eleven year old, were kind of left in the lurch, without regular teachers.  So they’d brought in one of the guest teachers from the Blue Heron as a tutor to keep them occupied and show them the ropes.  But that teacher was only active half the day, and the other half the day, the kids wandered the bounds of their property and hung out, making up games to play.

Which, to Avery, sounded pretty perfect.

They’d connected with similarly-aged kids from a neighborhood at the fringes of Thunder Bay, and they’d formed something of a friendly rivalry, sometimes banding together against kids from another neighborhood deeper into the city, sometimes hanging out all together, other times finding reasons to compete.</code>Aww, this <em>does</em> kind of seem like a pretty good deal for these kids. I kind of wish we weren't exploiting the freedoms that the Legendere kids have been granted to squeeze them for information, potentially disincentivizing the family from letting their kids meet other kids and interact semi-openly with them if they ever found out, but hey it's good news right now, at least.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="941076509282689084" id="chatlog__message-container-941076509282689084"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Thursday, February 10, 2022 12:02 AM">12:02 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Learned my lesson the first time.

There’s a chance there’s trouble on the horizon.  That about sums it up.

The Lord of Thunder Bay nodded.  She altered the wall of water, making a door.

Avery almost went through, but hung back.  “Is Gilkey around?  I wanted to give him some warnings in case he did spying of his own, and to ask him some minor stuff.  Fill in the gaps in my knowledge.”

The Lord of Thunder Bay shook her head.</code>Alright, we've got a good debrief/recap of all the stuff that Avery's found so far, as well as confirmation that Gilkey is...gone? Dead, maybe?

I think it's probably a look into how the trauma of Summer Break affected Avery, how it warped her sense of responsibility and probably played into a bit of her anxiety about managing her life.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="941078417842003980" id="chatlog__message-container-941078417842003980"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Thursday, February 10, 2022 12:09 AM">12:09 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">I think I'm going to take off for now <s>before I spend like an hour analyzing this passage about the Dreaming</s>, but thanks for reading along and commentating!</span></div><div class="chatlog__reactions"><div class="chatlog__reaction" title="wave"><img alt="👋" class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f44b.svg"/> <span class="chatlog__reaction-count">5</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="941083353728315402" id="chatlog__message-container-941083353728315402"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__reply-symbol"></div><img alt="Avatar" class="chatlog__avatar" loading="lazy" src="img/https___cdn.discordapp.com_avatars_330922971977875466_678c74ad1f4e4dc2ac8dec798a58f403.png"/></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__reply"><img alt="Avatar" class="chatlog__reply-avatar" loading="lazy" src="img/https___cdn.discordapp.com_avatars_325480568307449867_449d7ef9226ffdff029ce5b8e2bc41d4.png"/><div class="chatlog__reply-author" style="color:rgb(238,221,136)" title="jaymaniac">JayManiac</div><div class="chatlog__reply-content"><span class="chatlog__reply-link" onclick="scrollToMessage(event,'941058622534873149')"> These are all good points- Blake is someone I hadn't thought about comparing, and there are parts of him that map very well with what's happening in the Undercity. I still think he's different in that he <em>came</em> from innocence in a way that I don't feel happening here exactly- I don't see where that force comes through? -but at this point you've convinced me.
I still think that- while this <em>is</em> in some ways the point of knotted places, to have areas where the rules of the Seal are broken -it's still a bit surprising that the rules are breaking like this in ways that are so...accessible to practitioners? Like, sure the rules are fuzzy and it's 'locked off' from the rest of the world, but there's not a whole lot stopping the Bitter Street Witch from just fucking off now that she exists. Why don't we see <em>tons</em> of practitioners who used to be knotted people? Why haven't we seen any before? Is this kind of thing really <em>that</em> uncommon?- I feel like a version of it happens in a lot of major cities, and it seems like there would be practitioners like Bristow who are all <em>over</em> that. I suppose Bristow <em>was</em> kind of all over that. And maybe in the other knotted places there are simply overarching power structures and mechanisms of exploitation that generally prevent stuff like this from completely overtaking things. I do wonder if they're at a discount price in terms of accepting responsibility for them, because of their increased level of awareness and lack of 'place' in the world? 
Hey, with this knowledge at hand are the Kenneteers gonna Awaken Bracken or just let him keep being...well, a Kennet 'Other' somewhere between being an Other and being a sort of Witch-Hunter-esque Aware? Hey, considering that one of Guilherme's greatest 'errors' was bringing in the Witch Hunters only to have to fight them off, I'm going to say that counts as a poetic parallel to his hypothetical training of Bracken and thus is compatible with my theories. </span></div></div><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="330922971977875466" style="color:rgb(187,204,51)" title="zaximusq">A bird 🐦</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Thursday, February 10, 2022 12:29 AM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-941083353728315402">2/10/2022 12:29 AM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Why don't we see more mayors/senators/CEO's/etc of all different races and from all different countries?

One of Tomas’ friends, a man who Snowdrop had seen with Tomas a few times, was Willis Rodgers Loeb, name always given out in full.  A justice of the peace- which she gathered was essentially a judge, and who earned a hundred and sixty thousand a year, from a quick search online.  She wasn’t sure if that was a lot, it seemed like a lot, but was it I have five boats of varying size a lot?

More importantly, they’d seemed chummy, and that had prompted Avery to look up the guy on her phone.  Snowdrop had listened in to catch his name, giving her a starting point.  There were only so many Willises around.</code>Ah, so one of Tomas', not Florin's. That's fun. The karmic push-forward idea is interesting, having something comparable to a Blackguard handling all the bits and bobs of the organization so that the spirits forget that it's handled by the practice. There's probably a name for that, and Florin, Basil, and Musser probably know it. It's interesting that Florin, Basil, Musser, and Tomas are the examples we've gotten of practices which intersect the innocent world; I wonder what we're saying about those? Because that's a very...<em>distinct</em> group. </span></div></div><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="330922971977875466" style="color:rgb(187,204,51)" title="zaximusq">A bird 🐦</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Thursday, February 10, 2022 12:36 AM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-941085266775527454">2/10/2022 12:36 AM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">there's probably a name for that

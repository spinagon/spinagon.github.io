Lucy grabbed her bag from by her feet.  “Yeah, kind of?  Bit weird of a schedule.  One exam this morning, two exams after lunch.  We had our Gym health test and physical exam on the last day of school.  Pretty sure I killed it.  But we’re pretty free so long as we don’t make noise for anyone else having an exam.”</code>Tests upon tests upon tests, that's what the Kenneteers have waiting for them.

Her mom paused a moment too long.

“I take it you got word on Booker.”

“He’s coming.”

“But?”

“But just for Christmas eve, possibly after dinner-”

Lucy sagged back into her seat, ragdoll-limp.  “Why!?”

“Because there’s a party being held with a lot of the poli-sci students at the University and he thinks it’s crucial to go and shake hands and make his face known.”

“Fuck that.  Who’s throwing this party?  Can I curse them?”</code>Fuck, Lucy doesn't even get a whole ton of support in the form of the one person she can really trust and be 100% vulnerable with this Christmas.

Lucy shook her head.  “Me saying I don’t want to get into it is not me inviting you to try to riddle it out.  Neither of those things, exactly.  Arcade fell apart a while back anyway.  People killed the metaphorical golden goose.”

“Huhhhhh,” Mia drew out end of the sound.  “I guess they did, huh?”

“Another project in the works, we’ll see how it goes, but it’s looking good to start.  Just have to be more careful this time.”

Mia seized her arm and shoulder with such suddenness and force that it startled her.  Lucy backed away a full step, hand going up casually to fend off an attack.

“I want in.”

Lucy relaxed.  “Like I said, I think people are being way more careful after the arcade was ruined.  I can ask, but I’m pretty sure people are going to say no.”

“What if I’m really annoying about asking?”

“Then I’m less likely to bring you in.”</code>Aware Mia is probably a bad idea but like, not the <em>worst</em> idea I've heard, and I <em>do</em> want to see more of her.

Mia wheeled around, looking at her.  Then wheeled around, looking at Lucy.

“Or not?  Did I just screw up?” Melissa asked.

“No, we’re talking about that project,” Mia said, staring at Lucy.  “You brought her in?”

“Wow, share how you really feel, you bitch,” Melissa retorted.

“I did not mean it like that.”

“Lowly crippled Melissa, she’s not worthy, she doesn’t matter…” Melissa started, head lolling back, cane tapping against the ground.  She made a single exaggerated limping step.  “Why her?”</code>Ah, a <em>treat</em>- the story is giving us a gentle preview of what it might be like if Melissa and Mia had to deal with each other being Aware and you know what it's succeeding in making me reconsider.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1004175931583246386" id="chatlog__message-container-1004175931583246386"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, August 3, 2022 2:56 AM">2:56 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">She started toward Bracken, like she’d cling to him, but Melissa was at the ready, placing the end of her cane at Hailey’s collarbone, then pushing out so Hailey stumbled back.

The ensuing exchange looked a lot like a toddler on ice trying to stay balanced and make forward progress while a grown adult fought them.  Cane at knee, pushing.  Hailey’s foot slipped, and she sat down in a puddle of the moisture that had been tracked in on snowy boots.

“What the fuck?” Hailey asked.

“Don’t pester him.”

“Look, Melissa-” Hailey said, and, still sitting down, she tried to snatch the end of the cane out of the air, where it was poised ready.

Nobody reacted.  Mr. Sitton didn’t even look away from the point in space he was staring at, his eyelashes frozen.

A Fae sat on his desk, near the windows.  His hair was black, and long enough to pool around him.  His clothing was white lace that exploded upward in a way that left the middle of his abdomen, chest, and shoulders bare, while standing up around and behind his shoulders like a city in miniature.  The top extended down almost like a dress, but he was wearing flowing pants.  The trailing portion of his top, legs, hair, and the one arm he had out to the side to prop himself up were all artfully arranged.

His other free hand braided a lock of hair, fingers dancing as they drew out the seven-fold braid.</code>Oh no, he's hot. I mean I suppose he's cold, but still. I was just talking to my partner about how there's no words that mean sexy but are synonymous with cold.

“A refusal or inability to provide satisfactory answers will be treated as if all your answers were unsatisfactory.”

He drew a silver hair pin out of his tangle of long hair.  It was two feet long, decorated at one end, and drew together to a rapier point at the other.

“As far as they or any Innocent would know, the girl calling herself Lucy Ellingson had a breakdown, viciously wounding herself in each wrist, palm to elbow, before slashing her own throat.”

Lucy shivered for reasons other than the cold.</code>Well that's a...more concise clarification of the stakes here and what could await Lucy. It's so...cold, and so condescending-feeling, calling attention to her preference for her nickname as if it's another mark against her.

“And the non-innocents?  Kennet will realize, won’t they?”

“If they take issue, they can bring it to the Winter Court bureaucrats.  It won’t matter, but they retain that privilege.”

“That seems to be a refrain,” Lucy said.  “That whatever we do, it won’t matter.”

“So it is.  In more than our investigations here.  The longer you live, the more you realize little truly matters, and those things that do matter are not for people like yourself.”

“In my awakening, it was agreed on that we’d be allowed to lead full and rich lives, unimpeded.  A deal we made before spirits.  It matters, it adds context to other things.”

He gestured, with a movement of his fingers, hair sliding between them.

He wanted her to cite three things.  She could only think of two right away.

“It’s innocent ground.  The fact you’ve sealed it and put it away, it doesn’t change that it’s an institution, and the institutional aspects of Innocence are protected.  Our wars, our politics, our money, our education.”

He gave her a pointed look.

Asking for point number three.

“It seems completely and utterly unnecessary.  The time limit.  Setting up an adversarial situation.  You could set a time limit outside of this, by other means.

“They were Aware, not Other.”

“You are a practitioner.  In the absence of a Lord, I must look at how the powers of this place comport themselves and represent the ideas of this settlement- what is, what should be, what can be.

It hardly mattered at this point.  He’d shot down her other ones, and this was more supplementary.

“Lucy,” he breathed the word, now plaiting together a braid of five strands, one finger extended.

She waited for him to say something.

Then she realized.

“Yes.  I see it in the light that reflects in your eyes,” he said, shifting his posture, picking one hand up off the desk to sit upright, instead of leaning out to one side.  “You, who named yourself Lucille in your awakening, have clarified your name since.

Lucy shook her head.

“We can argue this point, before we move on to other, more important ones, but your time runs out, and these people will suffer from the cold when it does.”

The Faerie moved from a sitting position to a standing one.  He was taller than Mr. Sitton, but slender.  He kept fiddling with his hair.  She wondered if that was at the core of his particular conceit with Winter.

“The easiest way to clean up would be to cut them.  Hide frostbite with wounds.  Write the script in blood.  That Lucy Ellingson did not only maim and kill herself, but she hurt as many as she could before she did.”</code>It's admirable that Lucy keeps pushing and wasting her own time, arguing every damn point, but hopefully she can reign it in now that other people are clearly at risk. Remember what Dr. Mona said, you've got to save your energy for the battles that matter, and this guy's about to hand you a few that your defence will actually need to matter for.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1004179710001029171" id="chatlog__message-container-1004179710001029171"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, August 3, 2022 3:11 AM">3:11 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“You consort with goblins.

“Really,” he said, giving the word weight.

“It’s in the scope of my responsibilities,” she told him.  “I am a practitioner of Kennet.  I wield tricks, the spells I am taught, and powers given to me by the locals.”

“As asserted during your awakening?”

“Among other things.”

“The same awakening was already dismissed.  The ideas expressed are mutable, you stated a name and then you changed it.”

“Establishment,” she told him, pointing at him.  “I’ve established that reality, in blood, sweat, and tears.  Three vectors for the Self.  I’ve expressed those vectors in the awakening of Kennet, for Kennet’s growth, and when fighting its enemies.  Three expressions.”

A tidbit from her Law books.  How to establish something.

“When fighting its people.  A contradiction.”</code>And now he's just going to be a bitch about literally everything, cool.

“We demand it.  More than perfection, we demand respect.  Even in your dealings with me here, I’ve told you that what we’re discussing is more important than the test, and before I spelled out the fact that people here could die, you turned your focus to the clock and the tests.”

“You don’t know what was going through my head.”

“I know enough.  I’ve known enough individuals like you, young practitioner, to know how you think and how you act.”

She nodded slowly.

“Even after I told you their lives were on the line- lives I know you care about, you spoke with disrespect in your tone.  It seems you don’t believe me or value the threats at hand.  That alone is worthy of strict punishment and repercussions.”</code>Okay, I don't believe in strict punishment exactly but he's not 100% wrong here.

Life decisions.  And she had- two minutes.  Less than.  The clock was hard to read, all covered in frost.

She thought back to the implement ritual.  How it had come to an end.  A vision of the future.

“A husband.  One who will meet and work in concert with this goal.  To affect change, more and better than Charles Abrams.  To do something with Winter that matters.  To challenge your mindset and prove you wrong.”

“He cannot be mundane.  You know this as well as I do.  If you’re to make change, you need power.  He must be a practitioner.”

Lucy closed her eyes for a moment.  “Yes.”

The back of the class.  The piles of jackets and bags.

He gestured, and the frost began to melt and fade on everyone present.

She thought back, hairs standing up all over her body, goosebumps.

“I had you at my mercy before you knew I was here,” he said, dropping his hand from the lock of hair he was toying with.  “Interrogation done, I can report back now.”

She felt the hair that had been extended up her sleeve and looped around grow taut, arm jerking.

It caught on something deep inside her arm, and it pulled free like a buried cable pulled out of the ground, but sharp, not rough.  From the crook of her elbow to the heel of her hand.

Only to collapse, twisting, a rolling fall that draped her along the ground.  And from the ground back to an abrupt standing position, precarious, on the tips of her toes, one arm outstretched, the other curled around her body without touching it.

Every movement carefully controlled.  A tight spin became a leaping jump.  With arm strength alone, she stalled a backspring, her entire body’s backward momentum arrested, before drawing together, unfolding.

Sharp, sudden, unexpected movements.  From positions that made it look like she needed two or three steps to get square and stand again, she used one.  From positions where it looked like she could stand, she bounded into leaps or broke into spins, or thrust herself up instead.

There was emotion in it.  Something wound up and constrained fighting free, lashing out.  Movements looked like they hurt, because McCauleigh pushed herself an extra half-step too far each time.

Just… look pretty, I guess, and murder anyone who interferes in your pretty little parcel of the world.  Exceptions for the huge assholes like the Carmine Exile.”

“Sure,” McCauleigh said.  “Feels that way sometimes.”

The look in her eyes made that much clear.  That she felt that way.

Like she’d died and she was waiting for everything else to catch up with that fact.

“Fight,” Lucy told her.  “It matters.  So much of what we have, we fought for it.  If someone wants to beat you, taking it lying down doesn’t do anything except let them have a cushy time of it.  Make them work for it.  Maybe there’s a way through.”</code>I gave Lucy a lot of shit at the start of this chapter, for worrying over her exam and costing her the respect of the Winter Court, being unnecessarily antagonistic. And I still think that my way would've been one way to fight- to be polite and spend disrespect like a valued resource, to target arguments and attacks like that. But there's something even deeper within me that's nodding along with what Lucy's saying here, that understands. Maybe that part of me is less mature- it's the part that would make arresting me the most inconvenient process ever for any cop unfortunate enough to cross my path, the part bites and scratches and kicks and <em>knows</em> what Lucy says to be true.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1004188098353176587" id="chatlog__message-container-1004188098353176587"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, August 3, 2022 3:44 AM">3:44 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“She’s shockingly good at so many things.

But even if it’s about seeing Verona again after a couple weeks, couple months, couple years… whenever stuff’s done?  I think you want that.  I know she wants it.”

McCauleigh looked over at Verona.

Lucy was afraid she’d flip her middle finger up at the Faerie, but she just turned away, carrying on until the blowing snow hid her from plain view.

Lucy looked at the Faerie for long moments before Mia’s flustered and frantic approach disturbed her and she had to calm Mia down and answer questions.

Everyone’s asking the impossible.  Of us, of McCauleigh, of Kennet.  My mom’s asking it of me, and so are the Faerie, from two totally different directions.

“In my awakening, it was agreed on that we’d be allowed to lead full and rich lives, unimpeded.  A deal we made before spirits.  It matters, it adds context to other things.”

He gestured, with a movement of his fingers, hair sliding between them.

He wanted her to cite three things.  She could only think of two right away.

“It’s innocent ground.  The fact you’ve sealed it and put it away, it doesn’t change that it’s an institution, and the institutional aspects of Innocence are protected.  Our wars, our politics, our money, our education.”

He gave her a pointed look.

Asking for point number three.

“It seems completely and utterly unnecessary.  The time limit.  Setting up an adversarial situation.  You could set a time limit outside of this, by other means.

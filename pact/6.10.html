I glanced inside.  Inside the vacant apartment, Alexis and Ty were drawing on the floor in chalk.  Deadly serious.

I didn’t tell her why I was sorry.  I’d lie to let her keep worrying.

The way blake phrases it makes it clear how...<em>ugly</em> it is, revealing this part but not the next. She's here, probably feeling the worry about her own existence that Blake references, but probably just also feeling...well, like Blake did when he found out how long vestiges last. I think it's impossible that Rose doesn't at least <em>kind of</em> really care for Blake on some level, and <em>that's</em> an emotion that I feel should be repaid with honesty. I don't actually <em>like</em> manipulating people's emotions with lies, it's just...disgusting and sometimes I hate even watching it happen; I had to cover my face with my program when I went to see DEH, this is not something I handle well from any end, including bystander.

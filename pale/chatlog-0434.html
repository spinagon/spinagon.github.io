Each person was marked out in two dimensions, given a border and a faint background, and in each corner of that frame was an image.  It resembled old maps and where those maps often had dragons or the four great forces of the wind in the corners, the items contained in the frame of whatever she looked at with the Sight told her a great deal.

That was normal.  That was the sort of thing she expected to see.  She sat at a table in a crummy old roadside diner with a sign out front that had staining on the white plastic, where stainless steel had rusted and the rust had been spread by weather, and three other individuals sat with her.  Each of them were framed like playing cards, the colors of their clothing and bodies muted, and the depth of their bodies dampened, with the images in the corners of the Sight-provided frames.</code>I love cracking open an interlude, it's always such a friggin treat. We're getting Elizabeth Driscoll, who's one of those practitioners I always sort of wanted to know more about- one who seems very cool but too wrapped up in the establishment to do anything with that -and her introduction is via Sight, telegraphing that we're probably in for a heavy dose of worldview-shaking events and a chapter structured around what exactly she Sees. I'm guessing the map was her personal item and she went into detail about how she reads maps in her speech about it- which makes sense with her practice, insofar as I remember it. Ties her to location, and possibly to the ideologies that are inevitably tied up in the maps that we all frequent- what direction is up, how we portray certain lands, whether we put up political borders, etc. -possibly a mix of her own and the ideology of the person she's looking at, if I were to guess.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978432061402644480" id="chatlog__message-container-978432061402644480"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 1:59 AM">1:59 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">I'm also interested in the 'flattening' of images, possibly suggesting some ignorance of nuance.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978432370627711047" id="chatlog__message-container-978432370627711047"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:00 AM">2:00 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Also hi! we're back, I'm home from college again, hopefully we'll be much more consistent now and- interludes and my tendency to get sidetracked while reading them aside, I'm hoping to pick up the pace and catch up soon-ish.

Yeah.</code>Oh man, we're going to have so much fun with these motifs, <em>especially</em> once we start seeing characters we know, and pieceing together exactly what they mean. I'm assuming we're at least going to see Matthew's since that's presumably why they're here. I feel like I'd be much better at immediately figuring out what's going on with the positionings if they were just compass points, because those have all kinds of associations I'm familiar with.

She knew of Cyn but hadn’t ever had cause to meet her.  Cyn was a sleeping giant, roused by necessity and paydays.  Growing up, paying attention to the Driscoll family business, it felt like every conversation about an ongoing crisis tended to have that ‘should we bother Cyn about this?’ moment.  Usually followed by a no.  There was an Other who was a problem, dozens could die, should we bother Cyn?  No.  Let’s handle it in house.  The spirit world was leaking into the real world in a suburb in Waterloo, should we bother Cyn?  No, let’s not go that far.  Rope / temple / money / stone.</code>Ahahahahahahahahahaha neat, just giving us a quick glimpse of the gravity of our situation here, if those things weren't Cyn-worthy endeavors -and, indeed, if Cyn has never been called for all of Elizabeth's life apparently. Which is a running thing for the Kenneteers' bullshit.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978434476751331418" id="chatlog__message-container-978434476751331418"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:09 AM">2:09 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Cyn normally dressed like she worked in a garage, sometimes with actual coveralls.  She’d been dressed like that when Elizabeth had pulled up.  She’d made Elizabeth wait for forty minutes while she went inside, got dressed, and packed.  She’d emerged wearing a cream colored blouse with frills at the throat and a calf-length dress with a print on it that looked like 70’s wallpaper.  Her eyes were perpetually three quarters of the way closed but the parts of the eyes that Elizabeth could see glowed like cartoon radiation.  Green and bright.  She never turned off her Sight.

Cyn was a problem solver, especially when it had to do with gods and spirits.  She wasn’t on Durocher’s level, but she wasn’t minor either, and unlike Durocher, she was available, if expensive.  Most of the time, Durocher only paid attention if she found something interesting.  Cynthia Gaspard only paid attention if she had to, for five figure sums or situations that couldn’t be ignored.</code>Oh neat, and she's compared to Durocher. Wonderful. The idea of a gods and spirits problem solver is...fun and terrifying, when it's on this seemingly enormous scale. Like the macro-version of what I imagine a spirit doctor does. I also like how much Elizabeth <em>notices</em>, how people stand in relation to each other. It helps us as readers get some good context for who these people are, and it makes for this slow-rolling introduction that's got a lot to dig into. If Cyn works for money though, then bottom-right might be what can motivate someone- and working with what we have on milo, top right might be either the stuff they leave in their wake or their area of expertise. So murder and gods, for milo and cyn respectively.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978435105427161159" id="chatlog__message-container-978435105427161159"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:11 AM">2:11 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Angie Demarest had done more talking than the other three of the people at the table combined.  In the top left above her right shoulder were a pair of wedding rings linked together, but there was nothing on her finger, so that was pretty indicative of what the driving topic of discussion had been.  She scribbled away with the crayons on the dipsosable paper placemat, apparently trying to emulate Gogh’s Starry Night, with the placemat almost in the center of the table, with how she leaned forward and toward those she was talking to.  Wedding rings / portrait in a frame / baseball bat with nails driven through it / flower arrangement.</code>Theory seems to hold up for now, since 'posed' seems to be Angie's style/mode of expertise.

“How they handle themselves in front of an interested audience is how they’d handle themselves in front of the woman they’re in love with, and they’d be in love with me because the Whitts would give them a potion.  And because I’m sexy as fuck.”

We've got parasocial relationship commentary, brute-force manipulation, and whatever the fuck else!

“What the fuck?” Angie asked.  “Fuck off.”

He looked over at Elizabeth.  “I’m not interested in you.  Don’t think I’m coming onto you.  I’m just sick of this.”</code>Good communication of boundaries, random contract killer dude.

As far as I’ve figured it out, drawing on comments from Nicolette, Alexander took a weird liking to them after Nicolette ran across them in a bad way, Bristow thought he’d go after their town because it would annoy Alexander or uncover something about what Alexander was doing behind the scenes…”

Elizabeth pointed at the circled town on the map without touching it.

“…and Lawrence Bristow got on their bad side in the process.  So they sided against him, more or less, in the fight over the Blue Heron.

They fell silent, waiting as the waitress refilled Milo’s coffee again.

“Different sort of raw,” Elizabeth said, when the waitress was gone.  “It’s almost as if there’s a lot of things on fire, and these kids are standing really close to the fires a lot of the time you go looking.”

“Are they arsonists, or the matches in something else’s matchbook?” Cyn asked, sitting back.  She speared the tip off her pie with her fork.

“Can’t say for sure,” Elizabeth said.  She watched the vanilla ice cream melt across the top of her pie.

“Yeah.  Another big metaphorical fire,” Elizabeth said.  “One Alexander openly compared to the god capture that founded the Blue Heron.  Nicolette got a pretty parcel of power as her share for helping.  And so did…?”

Seeing, perhaps, how various ideologies and alliances and ways that information has been dealt out has put Elizabeth- who seems to be a good person so far, in a way I wouldn't even apply to Millie -on the wrong side of this war. I also keep thinking about how little we know of the Blue Heron God and the story behind it, the Judges rulings with regard to it, etc. In some ways it's...I suppose I'd call it the 'pre-inciting-incident' of this story, the factor that set all of this into motion. I wonder if that's something we're going to explore more in the future, or if we're kind of done with it? It's the inspiration for the Hungry Choir, the thing that obviously brought the Blue Heron into being...I sort of hope we get to see more of what happened back then but I don't know how that's going to fit in.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978442637906440214" id="chatlog__message-container-978442637906440214"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:41 AM">2:41 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Maybe as a part of fleshing Musser out as an antagonist, because even after Reid's chapter he really isn't a villain I'm interested in in the same ways I was interested in Bristow or Alexander.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978442766797402132" id="chatlog__message-container-978442766797402132"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:42 AM">2:42 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">That said, while the others exchanged glances, she took her bite of cherry pie with a bit of ice cream at the back of the fork.

I think because Elizabeth is very interested in <em>arrangements</em> of things. That's how she thinks, objects in corners, balances of ingredients and forces. Maybe it's how a Historian practitioner <em>has</em> to think. A little like a collector, but with less concise objects to think about.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978443160537661450" id="chatlog__message-container-978443160537661450"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:43 AM">2:43 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Father.

“What do you need?  You’re safe?”

“Think I’m safe,” she said.  Hearing the familiar voice of her father made her want to let her guard down.  To bring knees up to chest and get cozy, curling up in a chair or something.  “Had what might’ve been a close call, though.  We thought I should pass it on.”

“Tell me.”

She did.  Detailing everything she’d seen and Seen.

He answered, “I couldn’t say for sure about the ‘big’ one.  It sounds like a demiurge.  An Other with her own pocket domain, usually divine, almost always powerful.  Except this one has no defined borders.  But if she has that kind of structure around her, it’d keep the frame in a position to want to give the full picture.”</code>We get a bit more teased out here, Elizabeth's connection with her family and a hilarious guess about the Other that I'm now like 90% sure is Sootsleeves. It's interesting, we pointed out how the Paths and City Magic seem to work on similar principles when we saw Sootsleeves update herself...but it looks like it's one of those things where the Lost are similar enough to be confusing to people who know a lot about city magic stuff, because they work around similar principles but are much less well known.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978444438550491246" id="chatlog__message-container-978444438550491246"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:48 AM">2:48 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Me sending you.

“My instincts are we’re using all of this as an excuse.  I have this mental image of how this is playing out, that it’s like the moves Lawrence was making against Alexander, but there’s no Alexander in this.  Not that Alexander was even around or doing much when it all happened at the Blue Heron.”

“Hmm.”

“There’s no resistance, no pushback, just a greedy man taking power.  And then you’ve got this secondary group, off to the side.  Disruptive.”

“If we attach ourselves to Abraham Musser and he succeeds in all this- we’ve already thrived, compared to where we once were.  We’re being asked for advice.  We’re being paid.  The mortgage that was making your mother sick to her stomach is paid off.  We have so much work available to us your aunt and I are talking about bringing on apprentices.  We have sixty new Lords and many of them want to shape and grow the settlements in their domains in some fashion.  We are experts in that.”</code>See, I <em>knew</em> it- I knew that someone whose entire practice was about the big picture, and who seemed like someone with an actual moral compass (pardon the puns) wouldn't miss the huge blinking 'what musser is doing is kind of evil' thing. It doesn't sound like she has much to stand on in terms of actually doing things about it or working with Kennet, considering how much she cares about her family.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978444607392210974" id="chatlog__message-container-978444607392210974"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:49 AM">2:49 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Her father also doesn't sound like a bad person (yet).

“No, father, not necessarily.  But you told me to mind my instincts.  That you valued my input.  Especially now that I’ve had an education through the Blue Heron.”

“I’m immensely proud of you.  Of getting that education.  Of you being in a position where he considered your opinion worth something, getting our foot in the door.  Your instincts got us here.

“It feels hollow.  What we’re doing.  Hollow in meaning but with lasting ramifications.”

Her father fell silent.

“I’m not saying I won’t go.  I’m saying… you urged me when I was little, to listen to my fears.  To look for the reasons I was afraid when and if I felt that way.”

“The idea was to keep you aware of men and boys who would prey on you.  Practitioner families are isolated enough from law and societal norms… it makes it worse, I think.  It made me want to keep you from practice, as godawful as it sounds.  Because you’re a girl and they’re… there.  There’s an establishment of them.  Women too, I’m sure, in their own way, but-”

He didn’t finish the sentence.

Elizabeth, leaning over the counter with phone to her ear, looked across the diner at Angie Demarest.

She answered her father, “But the principle applies, doesn’t it?  You’re giving me these tools, this education, this knowledge.  Advice, to recognize my concerns when I have them.  Don’t give me all that and then fail to listen to me when these days and weeks may be the ones that define our family for the next few generations.  Please.”</code>The fact that Elizabeth feels safe around her father, feels like he's <em>home</em> -but isn't afraid to disagree with him is another green flag for me. Raising a kid who  isn't afraid to disagree with you, notices their own feelings and can express them to you, and has a fairly strong sense of Self is...well, I think it's not too shabby of a job. I'm still not 100% on his side, because I feel like a part of him probably knows that what he's doing by supporting Musser is wrong and kind of doesn't want to confront that, but I think he's definitely on the healthier side when it comes to raising a kid in the world of the practice.</span></div><div class="chatlog__reactions"><div class="chatlog__reaction" title="Ilovethis"><img alt="Ilovethis" class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" loading="lazy" src="img/https___cdn.discordapp.com_emojis_402832974560886794.png"/> <span class="chatlog__reaction-count">2</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978446980093206528" id="chatlog__message-container-978446980093206528"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 2:58 AM">2:58 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">He's also, you know, aware of the patriarchy, and of its effects in practitioner culture.

“We were on the wrong side of that then.  It’s only by your political acumen that you managed to stay in Musser’s good books.  We’re on the other side now.”

Yeah.  They’d sided with Alexander.  Elizabeth had been living in one of the workshops, working on a project, and she’d sheltered Alexander’s group for a few nights.

Her father’s voice took on a tone that sounded like he was breaking into a lesson.  “History is marked with times people found voices, opportunity, and took risks to change things.  Isn’t it worth it to try to be in a position where, perhaps, women have more of a chance, more positions of respect?  You were invited to that meeting.  How many young women were there?”

“Me, Nicolette, Marlen, Hadley, Raquel.  But Hadley and Raquel were there because their fathers were.  The rest of us- because we have skills, we filled niches.  And maybe because he felt like if he didn’t hire us, his opposition might.”

“I’d like for the next meeting of that import to have you invited because you’re head of the Driscolls.  A meeting where you have power.  Where you and others like you have more of a voice because the steps were taken now.”

She thinks of how to frame this, notices that her dad is mostly concerned with power and standing, and then tailors her argument to that, seeing that her initial moral qualms (which I suspect are the true driving force of this) aren't making the sort of headway a 'this could fail' argument will.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978449397182500864" id="chatlog__message-container-978449397182500864"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 3:08 AM">3:08 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">It's quite clever.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978449437070327848" id="chatlog__message-container-978449437070327848"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 3:08 AM">3:08 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">In case you couldn't tell, I really like Elizabeth.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978451336699998258" id="chatlog__message-container-978451336699998258"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><img alt="Avatar" class="chatlog__avatar" loading="lazy" src="img/https___cdn.discordapp.com_avatars_325480568307449867_449d7ef9226ffdff029ce5b8e2bc41d4.png"/></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="325480568307449867" style="color:rgb(238,221,136)" title="jaymaniac">JayManiac</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 3:16 AM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-978451336699998258">5/24/2022 3:16 AM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“I want to get rid of Angie,” Elizabeth said, quiet.

“How much of that is because she’s a detriment to what you’re doing, and how much is it because she’s loathsome?”

“You talk about wanting better for me.  I think she’s everything you want to save me from.”

Her father’s tone and manner of speaking had changed, to the opposite of that lecturing style he’d adopted earlier.  It was soft, weary.  Maybe it was his version of uncertainty. “What if she’s a test, Liz?  What if you proving your ability to manage Angie Demarest now is what leads Musser to give you power, a year from now, instead of doing what he’d do now, and putting some strong eldest son in charge instead?”

“What if me accepting the help of scum like Angie Demarest or the help of a murderer like Milo now is what passively leads to the accepted use of others like them in the future?”</code></span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978451345092780044" id="chatlog__message-container-978451345092780044"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 3:16 AM">3:16 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><img alt="Ilovethis" class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--large" loading="lazy" src="img/https___cdn.discordapp.com_emojis_402832974560886794.png" title="Ilovethis"/></span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978451681559846963" id="chatlog__message-container-978451681559846963"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 3:17 AM">3:17 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Elizabeth is so good at thinking like this, in terms of patterns, slopes, and maintaining some small sense of actual morality alongside an awareness of the evils of the system and society.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="978452348361904209" id="chatlog__message-container-978452348361904209"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Tuesday, May 24, 2022 3:20 AM">3:20 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Nobody’s impressed with you, you dry-ass, shades-of-brown wearing loser.”

Elizabeth was in the middle of reaching for her messenger bag with her wallet.  She picked up the bag and then turned around to face Angie.  “What?”

“Didn’t hear me?”

There is something seriously wrong with this woman.

Elizabeth opened her wallet and paid the tip, plus some.  Angie reached for the money, and Elizabeth stepped forward, closer to Angie, blocking the reaching hand.  “Don’t.”

“You’re not hotter than me.”

What brought someone to this point?  Where their worldview came down to something so small and petty?</code>I wonder the same kinds of things sometimes.

“If I do, you won’t ever get married, Angie.  Your vicious little family will never grow.  You’ll wither on the vine, so to speak.  I don’t need to fight you to destroy you.”</code>I'm not sure I agree with Elizabeth's decision to try to intimidate Angie back...but I understand it, and I even kind of trust that it might be the best way to get her off of Elizabeth's back for now.

“Durocher is as raw as you get,” Angie murmured, dropping her volume as the waitress came by with the pies on plates.

They fell silent, waiting as the waitress refilled Milo’s coffee again.

“Different sort of raw,” Elizabeth said, when the waitress was gone.  “It’s almost as if there’s a lot of things on fire, and these kids are standing really close to the fires a lot of the time you go looking.”

“Are they arsonists, or the matches in something else’s matchbook?” Cyn asked, sitting back.  She speared the tip off her pie with her fork.

“Can’t say for sure,” Elizabeth said.  She watched the vanilla ice cream melt across the top of her pie.  She didn’t want to eat while she was thinking and talking, so she held her fork by the very end, the tines tapping the plate faintly.  “Feels like the latter.”</code>Wink wonk. Practitioners being unable to comprehend a practitioner/Other relationship that's equitable, mutually beneficial, and strong without being dominating is never not going to be funny.

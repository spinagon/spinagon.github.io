<span class="preserve-whitespace">Alright! and we're officially back for 13.4, or as it appears, Pact: Pesterchum Edition. I know this isn't the first time Wildbow has done something like this- the parahumansonline chapters are a good example, as is Glo-worm, but I just love when we break format for a bit and it works. Was urban fantasy quite the genre I expected that in? No, but that just makes it all the better. I love that we get such immediate characterization here; considering that as of these past few months chatlogs have essentially been my primary form of communication with people I'm paying a lot of attention to how certain people present themselves through the medium. It's a kind of voice all its own. Do they type everything out in one big message that has to be broken into multiple paragraphs? or is every sentence a different message, like penny has here, so as to <em>emphasize</em> the <em>poetic form</em> of the <em>messages?</em> 
The junior council appears to be slightly more aligned towards everyone maybe getting along than their older, more ingrained counterparts, but with the bickering that any group of teenagers with this many conflicting interests will inevitably produce. As someone who recently was ambiguously in charge of organizing an irl friend group to communicate online for the forseeable future, making any kind of decision is downright impossible. I'm not exactly expecting the junior council chat to turn into meme central and totally drag everyone off topic, but if it happened it would be realistic.</span>

Whatever the case, I'm sure Blake's stance on the issue will be approximately "Ah yes, exactly as planned. This is going great" so that we don't even have him to back up our creeping sense of oh gods everything's gone horribly wrong.</span>

Maybe to a lesser degree, but when I want to emphasize something here I'll fall back on the same traditional tricks, such as rule of three.</span>

Hi Mags.</div>I can see why; I apply a certain tone of voice to people's chats, and try to convey a specific voice. It's pure dialogue, but it reads <em>so differently</em> for a whole bunch of reasons (things sorted into messages, typing styles, being able to write everything out beforehand). All that to say that the way Blake does this is pretty much the most dramatically unsettling way he could've (reinforcing my idea that the spirits still work through chat, perhaps? Or just that Blake is semiconsciously doing things in unsettling ways because he's been rewarded for it, even if he doesn't get a reward here because it's the internet- that could also be it). I read his tone here as very dead, hollow, creepy. Like, horror stories don't typically exist in chatlogs (actually who am I to say, I don't read horror stories?) but this has all the correct vibes.</span>

Penny[D]: That’s family.  You don’t pick and choose family.</div>Which is interesting, because from an anthropological standpoint, that's the staple of industrialism. I've actually been waiting for a chance to talk about this, because I find it fascinating. I don't know if I'm ever gonna make the video "Practitioner Families and How They Parallel Observed Subsistence Strategies and Kinship Organizations" but I'm pretty sure there's enough to say there that I might be able to. 
Duchamps resemble a clan with matrilineal kinship organization as it's observed in patriarchal societies. The women are distributed out to various families, who then send support and implied allegiance in times of crisis to recognize that. The Behaims are a straightup lineage. Both systems fall under what's called Unilineal Descent (one line of descent traced through either fathers or mothers, which determines who you consider kin). You don't pick who your family is, you stick with them probably until you die or until you can establish your own lineage somewhere else. Duchamps are a budding clan, uniting a number of lineages under a single banner. This is more common in agricultural societies, peoples who have a lot of stake in sticking to one place and cultivating something there.</span>

<div class="markdown">
<span class="preserve-whitespace">Industrialism, however, almost never follows unilineal descent, and when it does, it's typically carried over from an earlier subsistence strategy. Generally speaking, industrialism follows bilateral descent, wherein the idea of kin is individualized, and the only family you can't choose is that of the nuclear household (your immediate siblings, parents, and children; that's <em>it</em>). Everyone else is considered kin only if <em>you consider them kin</em>. My anth professor actually went through his family tree and roasted all of the family members he doesn't consider kin and wouldn't support if they asked him for help because they've been absolute assholes his entire life; it was kind of great. The point being that the ideology penelope would seem to be espousing here <em>isn't</em> a very industrial one; it's quite unilineal. As for what that means in the story moving forwards, I haven't quite parsed out, but it's something to keep an eye on with regard to how the Practice functions. Will we see a movement towards more bilateral descent systems in the future, as these ones lose power? Why <em>do</em> these systems still hold sway in this society?</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace">The trends I'm seeing are low-effort, biting comments that add nothing helpful. Low effort in that Craig is the only one who doesn't capitalize a single thing and uses almost no punctuation, which- while not so bad on its own -gives me less of a starting point for how to read what he's saying. And when what he's saying has already been vaguely annoying, the lack of punctuation or active <em>voice</em> to his comments make it easy for me to read it in the Least Charitable Way Possible. Like, was this annoying, biting voice what he probably intended while typing? Maybe not, but I don't have anything else to go off of!? The closest thing the typing style has to a personality is 'lazy'. And while that can work, or be circumvented by what you're actually saying...I find it's best to be clear, or at least unclear in an interesting way. It might be more of a me thing than an Actual Ethical Truth Of Internetiquette, since I put Kind Of A Lot Of Effort into <em>pushing</em> my personality through the text so it's not likely to be misread (meaning my expectation is raised) but I certainly find it annoying sometimes.</span>

They’re all complicit.  They know they’re complicit.  They know they can change things, half of the people in this chat probably know know they should have said or done something different when people were openly discussing what to do about Molly Walker.  Or acted after they heard about it.  Or hate their parents because their parents kept them in the dark.

Christoff: My big brother got his throat cut.  He went out like a hero, getting eaten alive.  I still don’t know how he deserved it.

Penny[D]: It’s more complicated than that.

Mags:  I don’t know if it is.  I don’t sleep easy anymore.  I haven’t since Molly died.  I was there.  I’m as complicit as anyone except maybe Sandra, Johannes or Laird.  Laird, at least, paid for it in a roundabout way.</div>I mean yeah, it's more complicated than that and also yeah, everyone's complicit. Just because it's a lot more difficult to act than peter is making it out to be doesn't abdicate them of responsibility. It's an explanation, but as an excuse? Questionable. That said, Peter's advocating hatred of your family as the proper response...I dunno, how'd that work out for you, pete?</span>

I kind of agree, but would also add that Peter being expected to reach out would not be in the top ten most fucked up things going on right now. Like no, there's no reason for him to, but if nobody steps up to be the better person then we're left with a bunch of justified assholes. Which is already kind of what we had. Which sucked. So I think he <em>should've</em> reached out, but never thought he was going to, and understand why he didn't.</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace">I can think of a couple right off the bat: I'm far less inclined towards criticism of the book- or just criticism in general- I love the perspective, but it's not exactly my tack with the text; In fact, my read tends to lean away from the specifics of the plot or even the themes of the story at times- in favor of examining ethos of the world at large, though there are plenty of exceptions; she has more life experience than I do, which makes for a distinct difference in the anecdotes and perspectives we bring to the table. It's perhaps especially striking because we're not actually that many <em>years of having lived</em> apart, but the nature of those specific years means we have very different roles in the world, and tools with which to see it. But I do also think the two of us have relatively little experience with each other's 'reads thus far (despite this taking me on a 30 minute tangent of reading Jade's livereads instead of the book in front of me), so I'd be very interested to hear the thoughts of people who've been around for both!</span>

I would be extremely worried about stepping away from this computer, having set the Thorburns on it, but I suppose Blake has more murder-y things to worry about.</span>

We know that Scourges are bogeyman-mages, which will already have interesting interactions with Blake. Pyromancy should be straightforward but who can say with Pact? I'm sure there'll be an interesting twist; it's also just a bad class for Blake to be up against, considering that Fire is one of his weaknesses. Spellbinders are new as far as I remember, Valkalla are either new or related to Valkyries- I'm intrigued either way. The Dabblers are unpredictable- and surprising. I wonder if that means they're any less powerful than others on this list? If so, why were they worth adding to the Duchamps' repitoir? Powerful connections? Dabbling family? Brothers who specialize in whatever the other one doesn't? Who knows?</span>

Crooked Hat had become a great cynic, it seemed, and if he was the type to carry the Abyss around with him, very literally, then did he take it home with him?  Did he subject his daughters to it?  Did they live in the Abyss?

Maybe someone in the chatroom had thought so, and thought they needed a way out.

Evan, I suspected, was another great sort of person.  In the moment I saw him fly free of the reach of others, papers trailing in his wake, I wished I could have seen what he might have grown up to be.  He’d survived the Hyena, only to get claimed by the elements.  He’d found talents in that, in sheer tenacity, and resourcefulness.  He’d been good enough at escaping that spirits had found a connection to him.

What could he have been, if he’d been allowed to grow up?</div></span>

1. I feel a bit rusty on the livereading, and that I'm providing far less imaginative commentary than I typically would.
2. it's very action-heavy, and I don't have as much to say on those parts despite their typical awesomeness, which compounds the issue as I wonder if I'm still qualified.
I don't know if I can promise more forthcoming reads since I have a number of irons in the fire, but it's in the plan. Luckily, it's been long enough that Jade has completely shot past me right to the finish line and we're not in any kind of spoiler limbo! So we've got that at least.</span>

Evan hopped down, perching on one of the gaping hole in my side.  “You’ve got some broken bones, too.”

“Don’t do that,” I said, sticking my finger under his bird feet to pry him free of his perch.  He hopped from my finger to my shoulder.  “And with luck, we’ll have our hands on some bones soon enough.”

It was one of the bigger meters, nearly as large as a microwave, but with the general aesthetic of a parking meter.

I glanced back again, just in time to see her throw it.  Again, without slowing.  She simply used the forward movement to drop into a four-limbed forward lope, moving like a gorilla might.

I moved a bit to the right, still heading full-bore away from her.

I felt the fear.

Those two things were very different, in how they affected me.  The scream was a reminder that I was dealing with humans.  That I was dealing with real people with real feelings, who could somehow be grossed out and alarmed.

The fear, that was something else.

I didn’t enjoy the fear, but I did feed off it.</div> When are we going to run into an Other that feeds on laughter instead and gets ten times as much power from it monsters inc style?</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace">I like the differentiation between the fear and the scream as representing the Other and Human parts of Blake, because it gets to the heart of something kind of interesting: that the abstract idea of fear is almost counter intuitive to feeling empathy for people who express it, to an extent. At least to the extent that it's a socially reinforced concept that in turn is utilized or creates or has some sort of causal relationship with the Drains</span>

I was going to do what I could to steer things towards a better path, and I was going to try to stay true to myself.  I’d veer one way or another, along the karmic path or against it.

But I was going to be Blake, when all this was said and done.

Even if Blake was less than half a person.</div>Now <em>this</em> is <em>fascinating</em>...that he won't throw his identity away (worm)<span class="spoiler spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)"><span class="spoiler-text">in the same way taylor did</span></span> to fix what's wrong with the world, or for a chance at doing so.

I’ve- I know I’m shortsighted sometimes, I’ve kept secrets from my girlfriend, I stressed my parents out so much, I called my brother a penis, I let my opossum eat too much.”

“This isn’t relevant,” the Aurum told her.

“Why isn’t it?  Isn’t that the whole point?  I don’t- I don’t think I’m a bad person.  I try to make the world better.  I try to change what’s broken.  I don’t know if I’m always good at it, but I try.  What did I do?”

“You broke an oath,” the Aurum said.

“Does that deserve me being forsworn for the rest of my life?  Sixty years of hell?”

“More, I’m guessing,” Charles growled the words, eyes on the fire.  “The Crucible will run for a while.  You’ve skipped over parts, you saw a sketch of what it’s meant to be.  The currents of this river don’t tug at you and force you into scenarios.  The price of entering didn’t wear you down to your core Self.  Most will fail.  For a hundred, maybe two hundred years, they’ll fail.”</code>And even more if Briserban is intent on keeping Avery here until Maricica's suffering is complete. I really love that Avery is...not appealing to Charles' empathy in a 'reverse this' sort of way (though I'm sure that's not too far from her mind) but also just to make him <em>face</em> the actual consequences of what he's done, in ways that he's afraid to acknowledge.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164121199958306816" id="chatlog__message-container-1164121199958306816"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 11:42 AM">11:42 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Charles,” Avery said.  She walked forward.  The centipede moved, sweeping through the space between her and the chair Charles was sitting in.  It blocked her from getting too close, the edges of the shells like blades, the spindly legs like rapiers.  “Charles.  Up until now, you’ve held back.  You- it’s like you want to not hold back.  You want to be vicious and kill us and be done with a problem, but you hold back.  Why?  You’re fond of us?”

“You’re karma’s unwitting agents, fueled by karma, nudged by it, helped by it.  If I could get you on my side, if I could get you to compromise or see my way as necessary, then that means Karma’s finally letting old grudges go.”

“There’s more to it than that.”

“There’s more to it than that.  Verona’s everything I liked in Alexander.  The kind of person I wish I could have been friends with.  Lucy’s… the kind of person I wish I was.  Sharper, more aware, more driven in fixing what I want to fix.”</code>Now <em>that's</em> fascinating. We knew the stuff about Verona- she and Charles have basically discussed it explicitly -but this is a newer sort of angle on Lucy, and I wonder how much Charles has actually thought about her in those terms? I wonder to what degree Lucy is aware of that- considering that she doesn't see shy about hammering that point when she confronts him. This is also just further developing the thread of Charles' relationships with women, seeing their good and enviable traits <em>as</em> good and enviable, but also imparted by some Other karmic force.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164121775878193162" id="chatlog__message-container-1164121775878193162"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 11:44 AM">11:44 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Summer camp, first year of high school.  We took a boat to get to the campground, big sailing ship.  She was there, I was thrilled.  I’d had a crush on her through all of middle school.  Not quite my first crush, but close.  Bright orange hair, dyed, raver look to her, massive jeans with legs so wide you could put both legs in them, covered in patches.  Melanie.”

“Carmine,” the Aurum said.

Charles waved him off.  “I wandered, and there were kids below deck on the boat, on the dock down the path from the campgrounds.  There was a boy, heavy boy, with one of the three girls at the camp.  Sitting in his lap.  Melanie was there too, talking to them, staying away from the boys who’d been calling her flat chested.  Girl in big boy’s lap says they’re going to make out, Melanie, why don’t you sit in Charles’ lap?  Melanie, nice, and bright and attention grabbing, says ‘gross’.”</code>I wonder why Aurum is trying to cut in, cut this conversation down? I suppose Charles is capable of reversing what he just did, so some of it is probably that worry, that he'll back out. But given Ryan's own fixation on his crush, it feels like there might be more to it than that. Maybe he simply recognizes the danger of this line of conversation.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164123335261691924" id="chatlog__message-container-1164123335261691924"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 11:50 AM">11:50 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“No, no, see, didn’t even hurt, then.

Me with no defenses, no barriers, no coping skills, just… a ‘gross’, right to the soul.  Absorbed.  And I maintained my crush on her for years, thought she was great.  She brightened the room.  Something to look forward to.”

“She was your Pam.”

“I’d rate her higher, personally,” he said, smiling with one side of his mouth, as he glanced over.  He looked away at the look on Avery’s face.  “I don’t have a crush on you, Avery Kelly.  But you have a light to you that reminds me of a bright person in brighter- only brighter days, because they were less dark.  If I’ve given you one too many chances, maybe it’s because I don’t want to extinguish that light.”</code>I really, <em>really</em> love this. Because I think Charles misses it here, but Avery is realizing that <em>they have this in common</em>. A distant crush, maintained not because of desire, but out of desperation and the need for <em>something</em> good in life. Avery has always tried to be understanding, and now she has this empathetic link to Charles in the moment he deserves it least.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164123715269828668" id="chatlog__message-container-1164123715269828668"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 11:52 AM">11:52 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Avery did too.  “Go to hell.

You’re sick, Charles, there’s something wrong with you.”

Charles barely flinched at her words.  Something unspoken seemed to pass between Aurum and Carmine.

“You kill light wherever you go!”

🟂</code>And the fact that they have this in common, this understanding, means that when Avery says this it has a <em>lot</em> more personal weight for her than it otherwise would.</span> <span class="chatlog__edited-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 11:52 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164124661181853718" id="chatlog__message-container-1164124661181853718"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 11:55 AM">11:55 AM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Go, be free my pretties, unbind and release any Others who were created more than two days ago,” Verona said, tearing out the pages.  “Don’t suppose any of you can break into a Carmine-sealed room?”

“I couldn’t name specific ones, but there’s a whole ecosystem of Others who deal with like, moving into pocket worlds, demiurgic Creations, fountainhead universes.  Some who usurp control from existing ones.  Remember when I told you about that one girl who showed up for the Aurum contest, when Avery got shot?”

They released.  One held on too long to a firecracker, getting thrown about ten feet toward the incoming Faerie and flock of fairies.  Others fired off another firework, a  blowgun made of a meth pipe, which the goblin put its entire face into, a Babette doll with legs fused together with a lighter, razors fused into the arms the same way, hooked up to a helicopter toy with a pull string, another Babette doll’s head with something jammed in the head, so it could be flung forward by the ponytail.</code>See, now this is exactly the kinda stuff I'm talking about.

The Faerie countered with a stirring of flower petals that blocked the worst of it, causing it to gum up and then collapse into a pile between her and Bubbleyum.

The smallest goblins from the barrage earlier were running around, and Verona could see as one fairy plucked the hypodermic needle from out of her mistress, and soared downward, stabbing a small goblin.

Bubbleyum’s eyes widened a fraction at that, eyes flitting from that tiny moment to the Faerie with the closed eyes and amber nails.  The Faerie smiled.

Bubbleyum, planting feet firmly in the thickest patch of flower petals, skidded it to the side, twisting her foot, and flicked her toe backwards, sending the resulting powdered glamour over at the fairy-goblin interaction.  A mess of flower petals and other substances washed over the pair, sending the fairy into a wall, where it stuck.

The Faerie pushed bubbleyum away, and Verona had to pull back on Lucy’s arm to avoid being pulled around the corner to see what happened next.</code>Not your typical goblin/faerie battle, it seems. Fairies acting more like goblins, and a goblin fighting more like Fae. Curiouser and curiouser. We know roughly where Brisrban stands in terms of this conflict, but the rest of these Faeries are a bit of a mystery for now. Probably safe to assume they simply want something interesting.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164128246993002497" id="chatlog__message-container-1164128246993002497"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:10 PM">12:10 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">The Faerie turned, walking back into the copse of overgrown jars of flowers and decorative wood that had taken over part of one wall.  A beckoning finger called fairies to follow.

The second last fairy to go- the one who hadn’t been plastered to the wall by Bubbleyum, was embracing the Babette doll with the razors melted into the plastic of the arms.  It flashed a fanged smile at them before trotting through.

When the Fae and fairy presence was gone and the vegetation started to shed, Toadswallow swore, “Shitfuck it!  Incestuous gods fuck it like they fuck everything else!”

“He’s mad?” Verona asked.  “But, isn’t that good?  I’m not sure I fully understood what happened there.  She’s figured out the eighth court thing too, right?”

“It’s competition,” Lucy said.</code>Ooooo, well <em>that's</em> interesting. Toadsy's goblins being around to influence the unusually-unmoored Fae who need to find new ways to exist in the human world is already having some fascinating consequences. That's the trouble with having a financially viable idea I suppose; not too much stopping someone from swooping in and trying their hand at it. I'm excited to maybe see more of this particular Faerie in future Otherverse installments, see what she does with it. I wonder if it was already a direction she was working in and this just confirmded things, or if she's picked up a new idea via Toadsy's goblins? In any case it's also interesting that Verona actually says 'eighth court', in that it's the first reference anyone has made to the Court System since it was dispelled, and I'm still not sure if people will still <em>remember</em> the last court system moving forward, or if 'eighth court' is just something that slipped through the glamoured censors (possibly as a result of mostly being discussed around goblins)?</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164128536639066193" id="chatlog__message-container-1164128536639066193"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:11 PM">12:11 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Hauling open the drawer of the filing cabinet, Verona found papers and books.

Blank.  Scribblings that she might’ve mistaken for Faerie writing, but there was no cohesion, no pattern.  She flipped toward the back.  It got worse toward the back.

“Weird.  Luce!?”

Verona turned just in time to see Lucy walking into the office.

The entire scene Lucy was walking into shattered like glass, panes breaking away and falling to the ground- same as when Verona had painted a picture of Kennet to lure John further away from it all, end of Summer.

Except Lucy walked straight out a window, the windowsill catching her at the knees.</code>Shit, yeah I had a feeling that that was a bit too easy.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164129415836471306" id="chatlog__message-container-1164129415836471306"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:14 PM">12:14 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">She quickly brought her hand to her mouth, finger there in a ‘shush’ gesture.

The Fae let out a little half-laugh.  “No.  Do you even know what it means?”

“Some idea.  If I’m building a nuke in my backyard and you’re building a nuke in your backyard and we both run into each other in the store with the same things in our shopping carts… we might not be friends, but neither of us wants to blow the lid off the fact it’s possible, right?”

“In a sense, except for two things.”

“Oh no.”

He smiled.  “I don’t like you.  You opposed my Maricica.”

“Oh.”

“And I don’t think you’re in a position to ‘blow the lid’ off of anything.”</code>So Brisrban <em>is</em> at least a little bit in on whatever's being built here, whatever collaboration of ex-forsworn, vagrant faerie and goblin-gunk is brewing, using the Crucible as its curtain.

Or rushing away.  The Faerie was at the center of that.

Either way, it was a warped picture before the Aurum’s centipede coils slammed into the door, closing it.  The body of the centipede pressed against the door to bar it closed.

Verona turned.

Charles was there, by the window, one hand at his side by the stab wound.  The Aurum settled in, seated on his centipede’s head, the centipede body spiraling out across the room, gleaming and dangerous, shell and legs making navigation hard.

“This is what you did to Avery?”

“Avery’s in progress as you are,” the Carmine said.  “Facets of ourselves are with her right now.”</code>Yeah, figures. Maybe, just <em>maybe</em> they can use the fact that Aurum and Charles are both there to argue that an appeal is being made before both of them?

For your oath made to Lucy Ellingosn, that you would try harder, to maintain your friendship.  I call you Forsworn.”

There it was.  She felt numbness creep over her.  Like being stuck in her dad’s room, times a hundred.

“Bull,” Verona said, voice soft.</code>Of course. Avery has tried to use the fact that her forswearance concerns Verona to her advantage, call Verona to the stand and all, but that's not the game that Charles is playing. He's trying to make sure the forswearance and the focused karma specifically attacks their attachments to each other, further isolating them.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164130550718681099" id="chatlog__message-container-1164130550718681099"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:19 PM">12:19 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">The centipede’s coils unfurled, then raced by, sawed through wood, book, and other materials.

Sawdust, parchment, and sparks filled the air, blended, while Verona remained where she was, tense.

Part of the forswearing process was you couldn’t call a forswearing and then hurt the person you called out.  Otherwise, the best response to a forswearing would be an all-out offense, murdering the person calling you out before they could string enough words together.  The process of calling this out brought out a whole bunch of points of Law and everything else, securing things.

Which was what she was relying on, going for the books.  It also tied her hands, keeping her from hurting them.

Not that she was sure she could.</code>And of course she's still going to fight it every step of the way, using every trick from every book she's read</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164130868462354432" id="chatlog__message-container-1164130868462354432"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:20 PM">12:20 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">It's the same kind of reaction I have when cornered, trying to think of every way around, every way out, every way to make what my opponent is doing as inconvenient for them as possible</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164132352650387477" id="chatlog__message-container-1164132352650387477"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:26 PM">12:26 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“Another change of venue.

“I see them.”

The lights went out again.

She’d thought if she practiced enough, she could knock herself unconscious.  If she was unconscious, proceedings couldn’t continue.  If Avery’s was in progress, instead of being finished, there had to be a reason.

She was still bleeding a lot.  Cuts on her forearms, bone deep.  Cut at her back, she didn’t know how deep.</code>Fuck, this is just <em>heartbreaking</em>. Like, the way it's framed is that she's found this loophole that she hopes to get through, but in terms of her <em>actions</em> it's just this deep, fearful desperation, that she would rather self-destroy than be destroyed in this way.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164132978130174063" id="chatlog__message-container-1164132978130174063"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:28 PM">12:28 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">They were her people.

Used against her now.

“Settle down,” another woman told her.

Verona screamed, and her emotions were a confused, vented mess that left her unsure if it was fear or rage or other pent up things.  Fear at losing magic, the only thing that had made her feel worthwhile, prior to the Awakening ritual, except being Lucy’s friend.

Losing her friends, and feeling something that would -no offense to Mal or Anselm- would dwarf those feelings.

Mal and Anselm.  The other Undercity people.  People she’d worked with, fought like hell to get into alignment, cooperation.  Others who hadn’t even been killed had lost people close to them.  She hadn’t even dipped her toes into how bad that would be, and it scared her.</code>The fact that her own people are the ones holding her down is a unique cruelty here, harkening back to Verona's fear of going back home to her father without magic available as a defense mechanism. She is a community-builder, and the combination of her own community being used against her with the removal of her central source of empowerment is so twisted.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164133659226407002" id="chatlog__message-container-1164133659226407002"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:31 PM">12:31 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“You fucker!” she shouted.

Mal, Anselm, Ramjam, Butty.  They started out shitty but they made the world better.  How do you take that and shit all over it?”

Her voice cracked at that last bit.  She tried to scream, but there wasn’t enough there, so it became a moan.

“My house.  I built up that house, I fought to make it mine, I put so much of myself in it.  So many memories in it.  Practice stuff in it.  My bookstore.  How do you destroy that?  Why would you destroy it!?  Your entire thing is summoning, you fuckass!  How do you see these things where someone’s taking the raw materials they got and making something cool, Kennet Below, the house, Kennet found, the markets, my badass fuck-off practices, and destroy it, fight it, smother it all under this bullshit!?”

“Put her in the chair,” the Aurum said.

The moment she was off the ground, she was fighting again, scratching, trying to bite, pulling away.   “Where’s your artist side, Chuckles!?  Where’s that love for something well made, Chuckles!?  Do you even know anymore, Chuckles?”</code>Avery's version- the slow tragedy, the calm, somber conversation -definitely hurt, but Verona's desperate, panicked outrage just hurts <em>me specifically</em> so much more. She does a similar thing to Avery here too, forcing Charles to look at everything he's done, pulling out all the stops, calling him 'Chuckles' <em>three times</em> in an attempt to invoke that more lighthearted relationship they shared, to try to bring forth any ounce of friendship that still might linger in him</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164134141965647892" id="chatlog__message-container-1164134141965647892"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><img alt="Avatar" class="chatlog__avatar" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/540332766282383360/41566dfb2ac87337c4acafa1d7ab2a82.png?size=512"/></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="540332766282383360" style="color:rgb(0,119,187)" title="tisarwat.">Tisarwat</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:33 PM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-1164134141965647892">10/18/2023 12:33 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">Verona feels so visceral here.

“I don’t know.”

“It’s always been a fear that if something happens, I’d have to explain to Connor and Kelsey, or Sylvia and- Brett would have to know, right?  I don’t like him but he was decent once, and maybe if he heard the full story, it’d be a wake up call?”

“I would be surprised.”

“I didn’t handle it that hot when Avery went missing.  Couldn’t do much more than tell them what I knew and leave it hanging.  And now she’s stuck in a room with a man who’s trying to kill us, and maybe that room’s an arena?  And he doesn’t want to bring me into it, because I’m the best at fighting?  But it’s the same situation?  I have to tell them I don’t know what happened at the end?”</code>I think there are hints of bringing the Lucy-as-parent narrative full circle with this. Because the fear she's expressing here <em>is</em> the one that Jas expresses for her. And she understands that her friends aren't her children- she respects their choice to sign up for this fight, she respects their <em>agency</em> -but even so, she struggles with the responsibility, with resolving that same inner conflict Jas has been running up against.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164140371815702548" id="chatlog__message-container-1164140371815702548"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 12:58 PM">12:58 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">“I fought so hard to be stronger, to hold up my end.

I got up on so many cold-ass mornings, wore a sports bra and bike shorts in a cave to learn sparring, I put up with Guilherme being a butthead.  I got hurled into trash bags more times than I can count, sparring with Bubbleyum.  And it’s not enough.”

“You’ve done plenty, Lucy.  You’ve gone above and beyond and that’s why I decided to become a Founder.  To build Kennet found.  Even that wasn’t enough.  There’s a chance I’ll be forsworn and unraveled if something happens to any of you.”

“If it helps, I don’t want you to be.  Tell Charles that, if he tries to pull that?  Or whoever tries?”

“I may well deserve it,” Miss said.  She sounded melancholy, maybe even a bit defeated.  “If it comes to that, Lucy, it won’t make much of a difference.  Being forsworn, being unraveled-”

“It’s bad,” Lucy said.  “You have a whole realm that’s yours, that you’ve built up.  We lost a lot of Kennet below.  You’ve put a lot of love and care into Kennet found.”

“A love and care I didn’t know I had in me.  But if this Crucible sweeps over the region, I fear I’ll be unraveled anyway.”</code>And I do really love that these two get a moment to put their respective arcs in parallel, recognizing themselves and each other for sacrifices made. Even if Miss doesn't actually have direct answers (tbf, not her specialty) I feel like she's still able to be a guiding or perhaps simply <em>grounding</em> presence for Lucy in this moment. Both of them ultimately dealing with having potentially sent Avery and Verona to their deaths. Miss is kind of able to offer this motherly source of comfort along with a- perhaps grim -camaraderie, even if it's just in the form of a listening ear. Even if she doesn't have ears.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="chatlog__message-container" data-message-id="1164141120113082388" id="chatlog__message-container-1164141120113082388"><div class="chatlog__message"><div class="chatlog__message-aside"><div class="chatlog__short-timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 1:01 PM">1:01 PM</div></div><div class="chatlog__message-primary"><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve"><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">The noise in the air was similar to the visual ‘noise’, of clouds and dust.

“You aren’t exactly upright either.”

“It won’t change anything.  You and I both know the kind of harm you’d have to do to me, the way you’d need to torture me, to break me and get me to change my mind?  It would turn you into a monster too.”

“Only the follow-through remains, they have no say or priority in Law.  Cleanup will be necessary, putting Others back in books, codifying them.  London supports us, your enemies are fleeing the region.  We’ll want to tend to the Sword Moot, so you aren’t completely neutered, but that’s hours from finishing and we don’t need hours, and it’s a matter of time before they vacate the region too, abandoning the Moot and their ability to enforce Moot Law.”</code>You'd think a former Fugitive of Fortune would think twice about counting his eggs while he's still at the table.

If they don't know exactly what's giving Aurum and Carmine the ability to exclude Sable and Alabaster, then getting out and asking one of them would probably be the best bet.

She's still here for her friend. I think that means more here than Julette's perspective, though that also could've been fitting. Tashlit has been a 'Kennet Other' for a bit longer, and her connection to the vast thread of the narrative is therefore a bit more solid.

The garden at the center of the school was the center of it, but others had gone into the building.  Books and papers rained down from above.  Voices filled the air, rebelling, shouting their anger, their fury, or their rejection of the Carmine and Aurum.

She had no mouth to shout with.</code>I think I'm going to have to call a break here for the purposes of Doing My Homework and also Eating Breakfast but before I go I do want to say I love that Tashlit is the one we zero in on here. We got Snowdrop- Avery's familiar -Grandfather as Lucy's prospective familiar in the last cut back to the Kennet Others, and now it's Tashlit, standing in for Verona somwhat regardless of whether the two might actually be familiars one day. She's still here for her friend. I think that means more here than Julette's perspective, though that also could've been fitting. Tashlit has been a 'Kennet Other' for a bit longer, and her connection to the vast thread of the narrative is therefore a bit more solid. Tashlit's opening lines here also make a really powerful parallel with the snipped of Verona we just got. Tashlit has no mouth, no words to express herself, whereas Verona has <em>only</em> her words, only the rigged rhetorical arena. </span></div></div><div class="chatlog__header"><span class="chatlog__author" data-user-id="407674475312578562" style="color:rgb(187,204,51)" title="jarlzarl">Jarl Zarl (Don’t mind pings)</span> <span class="chatlog__timestamp" title="Wednesday, October 18, 2023 4:06 PM"><a href="#chatlog__message-container-1164187851299225610">10/18/2023 4:06 PM</a></span></div><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class="chatlog__markdown-preserve">I love Tashlit here so much, she’s got no voice but you bet your ass she’d be shouting if she could</span></div></div></div></div><div><a href="chatlog-0678.html">Next part</a></div></div>

You’re not irritable, you’re not distant.  You know that’s sort of why I said I’d invite people over?  To see how you fared?  And because it looked like you really needed people?”

“I didn’t, but it makes sense in retrospect,” I said.</div> Joel is <em><strong>such a good friend</strong></em> and he's really got Blake figured out here. The sad thing being, of course, that Blake <em>has</em> to dance around topics and give indirect answers, which probably really hurts Joel because they have this kind of rapport and he doesn't know what Blake's hiding, or how to help. That kind of feeling can tear you up from either end.</span>

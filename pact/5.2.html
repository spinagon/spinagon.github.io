When I pushed on a door to let myself into the next section of the building, I found it hard to do.  Hard to say how much was blood loss, how much was a loss of personal power, and how much was my disconnection from reality.</div> I'm definitely gonna be keeping these in mind as we move forwards through the arc as Blake's self-evaluated aspects. And as for whether it's blood loss, personal power, disconnection from reality? I have to believe that on some real metaphysical level it doesn't matter one bit, and only does <em>here</em> because Blake makes that distinction. Parts of this remind me of breaker states, which you could probably evaluate in terms of essence</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace">I was thinking about how the universe functions as the writer of a story, with its inhabitants as both its characters and its audience. The universe, as a writer, has things that it thinks are bad, and things that it thinks are good. When the people (as characters) do good things, they are rewarded in the eyes of the story and vice versa. But when people (as the <em>audience</em> this time) <em>notice</em> the universe shoe-horning its message into their lives in a predictable way, it stops.</span>

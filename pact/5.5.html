Covering things up on her side of the window, leaving space uncovered to let faint light through.  It was… it was feeble and weak, I had to admit.  It had seemed clearer in my head.  But I had a dim oval of moonlight surrounding me.

Something moved in my peripheral vision.  Not Evan.  Not Rose.  A stirring.</div> Okay first of all, that's an awesome light circle that just got made there</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I saw it to my left.  It was barely visible in the shadow before it retreated to further darkness, vague and nebulous when I looked at it without really looking.  It moved like a hand without an accompanying body, of its own volition, using fingers to drag itself along the floor, perhaps.  A bulky, multi-limbed, asymmetrical body, with limbs that moved so quickly they might have been flickering.  Matte black.  It might have been a spider gone wrong ten times over with some full-body cancer, or a giant hunchbacked man with a dozen arms that were stretched long enough to reach over and under one another.  But it wasn’t.  It was a demon of the choir of darkness.  Something that had been given life in counterpoint to creation.  It was aged limbs, withered ones, from every species and no species in particular.

It was nearly silent.  There was only a shuffling, the faintest scrape of body against floor.</div> AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH THIS IS THE COOLEST FRIGGIN THING IN THE WORLD!!! It's a buildup and then a payoff of this pure incredible disturbing <em>awesomeness</em></span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">The front of the body disappeared, and some form of lower body or tail dragged behind it, like entrails trailing behind a man that had been bisected, a spine without the accompanying stomach, or a naked tail.  The trailing flesh was bent in places, as if it had been broken badly and bones had reset improperly.  A kind of detail that teased, invited me to look, as if it were a clue I could use.  But looking was a trap.

The thing didn’t stop moving.  I could make out the larger body shuffling forward to my right, and the ‘tail’ was still being dragged along the floor to my left.</div> Like, it's just so cinematic to me, the horror standoff here. I never watch horror movies and I don't know shit about movies in general but I can picture all the camera angles and movements and lighting in perfect clarity here</span>

She hadn’t gone into any detail on this trick.</div> Maybe she's running on sokka's instincts! I love this idea, that the rule of three could just be used to brute force a demon's name out of them. I don't know if there's basis for it, but I bet if you <em>think</em> it'll work....</span>

The only movement was the distortion in my field of vision, where my eyes had gotten used to movement.  The darkness kept moving, even as the demon remained still.

There was silence, still enough that I could hear my own heartbeat, the creak of the open front door being moved by wind, and the periodic drip of fluids falling from the demon’s body overhead.</div> An abstract demon ate <s>my homework</s> any ability I once had to express how fucking cool this is</span>

My feet were lifted clear of the ground.</div> Sweet Lords, he's dead, that was a terrible plan I take it all back doing this tonight was an awful idea, hell just leave the fucker in the factory until you're king of the universe and then come back carefully</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Evan found his way through the gaps between the coils, segments and half-formed limbs, momentarily ceasing all flapping and continuing forward with momentum alone, so he could make himself small enough.

I was already moving.  Sluggish compared to Evan and the demon both.  I hopped over the flame, meager as it was, stumbled and crashed to the floor.

It loomed to the side, and I twisted my head away before I could look, twisting my arms around as well, can in hand.  The contents sloshed out, touching the short patch of dying flame that still remained.  It exploded to life with light and violence.

The demon was burned as if the flames themselves had touched it.</div> The moment you realize "oh, <em>this</em> is the conflict" is perfect, because it involves Blake moving, it's so brutal and ruthless, it's dynamic and rancid and powerful</span>

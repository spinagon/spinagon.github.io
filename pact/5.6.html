The light the flashlight provided was seductive.  I could feel the demon’s presence here.  No connection I could make out, nothing obvious or apparent enough for me to put my finger on it.  When the light was cast on more distant objects, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the demon was just behind me, or to the side of me.  So close it could caress my cheek.  When the light was closer, it was out there.  Watching.

It loomed to the side, and I twisted my head away before I could look, twisting my arms around as well, can in hand.  The contents sloshed out, touching the short patch of dying flame that still remained.  It exploded to life with light and violence.

“What?”

“Three others.  Maybe more, but I only saw three.  At least one was a goblin.”

“We didn’t bring help.”

“We don’t remember bringing help,” I said.  “If we don’t remember bringing any help, there’s none left, so I have to question how much it matters.  It’s a moot point.”</div> That's such a cool payoff to all that stuff that didn't make any sense before, I was really confused.

The man was dressed as well as anyone else on the street, his hair cut short, neatly parted, a long coat over a suit with a tie, and over-the-ankle boots with slight heels.  The only oddity, one that no passerby seemed to take note of, was the face.  The familiar’s face appeared to have been carved off and pulled free, only to be haphazardly nailed back into position, with nails all around the edges.

The boy was still young enough to be innocent, it seemed.</div> And this is a good rule to establish about him up front, and maybe a hint into why he's called a bogeyman- he's something that adults take no notice of, but kids can see for a monster. I don't think this is how it works with <em>all</em> Others, but I could be wrong. After all, I saw a ton of supernatural stuff as a kid that I now chalk up to an overactive imagination and a tendency to blow through fantasy novels faster than all the authors on the planet could write them. Maybe I just lost a bit of innocence, and now I readily shake hands with people whose faces fall off?</span>

I was a factory worker with gentle hands, genial, a father.  You knew my friendliness was borrowed, the natural charm and kindness taken with the face, and you could peer past the act when even his family couldn’t.  You still made the offer.”

<span class="preserve-whitespace">I've got somewhere to be in about two hours, but maybe we can knock out 14.4 before then- I've been a bit busy for a few days and I've missed the chance to read (not to mention that I now have a quota to maintain if I want to catch up to Pale). When last we left off, Blake was taking some artistic inspiration from a dragon and also his vision of being a ruthless all-consuming bogeyman in the Drains! I mean he always <em>was</em> a fan of winging it, I suppose<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I’d committed to walking the line between human and Other.  If I felt like wings were somehow more of an appeal to my human side, despite all conflicting evidence, was that a bad sign?</div>Maybe? I think the Abyss is less picky than all that, if it makes sense. The Abyss sees the bird spirits and tree spirits within you, and finds it easy to <em>work with</em> those to channel power through you, rather than work against them. Things that appeal to your human self will be wound up with what the Abyss has in store for you whatever you do- it's just going to use giving you those things, to further its own essence. I think it's possible for blake to become more <em>blake</em> without becoming more human. And also, symbolism and surface level things are important, and it's just the flat-out truth that a human-looking body is kind of a little bit more human than a body with wings. Other-ness exaggerates a part of 'human' that fits with you and the power you identify yourself to, so...that seems pretty textbook for what Blake is doing.</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Which said a lot.  As I thought on it, I wasn’t sure I’d ever been able to remember exactly what projects I’d attempted and failed.  There was only my crude exercise in drawing the circles around the demon Ur.  Fragments here and there.

That, in turn, led me to the understanding that the art wasn’t mine.  I paused for a moment, hands freezing midway through my work.  A quiet horror, almost a sense of betrayal, but far from specific, hard to place, in terms of blame.</div>This is fascinating- also really sad. We've had Blake pegged as 'the artist' of the pair, as opposed to Rose's scientist, but maybe there's something more nuanced at work- the <em>trying</em> to be the artist is Blake, but the result and the nature of the project itself was evidently something that went with Rose.</span>

That dawning realization that some of the most intense, heartbreaking moments of frustration were because the other person had something we needed?

Friends.  The idea hit me.</div>Yeah...which is just, well- tragic, for one, but also makes a lot of things more understandable. Blake has every instinct related to interpersonal connections, and the not-thorburn karma to back it up- not to mention the people he was already connected to, or was able to find more connections to. I don't know if she <em>dwells</em> on it, but it's probably pretty hard to ignore when she spends so much of her energy in a day just trying to connect with people and get them on her side, and then Blake walks up having made friends with most of the unaligned Others in Jacob's Bell and also someone who was supposed to be working with the duchamps in the first place...she might find it difficult to ignore.</span>

A bat’s wings, not a bird’s.</div>If anything I think <em>this</em> is the confirmation that while the Abyss is <em>working</em> with Blake's desires, it's certainly putting its own spin on things that Blake doesn't really have a say in. He gets to fly, but not like he would've wanted, not with <em>bird</em> wings. This description is also really cool and I don't have too much time to dwell on it but I had to pull at least a piece of it. The prose is excellent here.</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace">Interestingly, this beat about the sweatshirt ties into a thought I had that I'm not sure I ever shared: that you have to be naked for the Awakening Ritual because otherwise the clothes you're wearing will be clocked by the spirits as a part of 'you'. At least, the spirits in charge of that part of the bureaucracy would, and that would cause conflict, and eventually the spirits would either forswear you immediately, or as soon as you tried to wear anything else. Blake has entered into a different system, with slightly looser rules to it, and since he entered with his sweatshirt, that becomes part of his identity. So as his form changes with the Abyss, it uses his sweatshirt as much as it would use any part of him.</span>

Given how much she seems to hate white colonials and how well people like Alister, Sandra and Johannes fit that bracket, wouldn't actually put it past her. <em>especially</em> if, like blake theorizes, her house isn't frozen in time because it's not technically jacob's bell in some sense. I called it unlikely before, but if it <em>is</em> the case then she jumps up the list of suspects. I still don't know that it's her, because I don't think the book would point us directly to the assailant immediately, but it's possible that she, briar girl, and a number of the other suspects are all working <em>together</em> to accomplish this. It's also still possible that Padraic is involved, especially since he doesn't seem to think he'll be affected like the rest of Jacob's Bell.</span>

I frowned, looking at the fallen trees, and the poles that had been part of the mechanism.</div>Interestingly, it doesn't seem so- the only magic we've seen Crone Mara use is that which keeps her alive- I wonder if there's something to that, whether it's why she's kept her humanity so long despite being alive long enough that most people would be entirely Other-ified Padraic style, or if it's got something to do with hating the Seal and the way the Practice works in these parts...I mean, she used the birds presumably, so she doesn't use <em>no</em> magic.

“They’re not being condescending,” Peter said.  “They really are superior.  They’re better than us, and they’re acting like it.”</div>Uhhhh....this is an interesting take, and kind of suggests a few things about Peter. First that he thinks of things in terms of who's 'better' or 'superior' which we could've guessed but is surprising to hear this overtly, and next that he measures those things in some convoluted way that puts <em>Blake</em> above hi- okay well a lot of people are better than Peter by virtue of...well, any virtue, really. But if I had to guess, it's related to the last two quotes I pulled: the idea that blake is more physically capable, that he can fly, that he can <em>do</em> something when shit starts blowing up, and thus is "better" or more "superior" than Peter, who probably feels a bit helpless here. That's probably a lot of Roxanne's mindset here too, along with the whole "reeling from the world not working like I think it should" thing.</span>

Attack, attack, attack.  That’s her pattern.  When the attacks fail?  Undermine, sabotage the competition in less direct ways.  Paige?  Act better than she is, raise herself up, place herself on a pedestal.  When that fails?  She breaks down, and she breaks down hard.  Recognize the pattern, and you know how to play someone.  All that emotion gets turned inward.”

“I don’t care,” Roxanne said.  “Stop talking?”

“Gotta talk, part of how I deal.  You and me?  We’re manipulators.  Different environments, but we play the same game.  Where we differ is in how we deal when the manipulations fail.  I’m not so different from Ellie.  I retreat.  But where she changes things up, I retreat to study.  I come back better, smarter.”</div>yep, helpless in a situation where manipulation can't really <em>get</em> you anything- and he's pegged Roxanne's problem too, pretty much as soon as I did, which is probably another sign that I should stop talking so much and let the characters analyze themselves.

Many are mine.  Hundreds of years of work.  I saw things follow in our wake, things stirred into existence by our being.  Your Others, echoing our intelligence, echoing our pride and fear and pain, to join those Others that were here before the first people.  I am familiar with them all.  I know what man is, and I know that your love and law and fairness are invention.  Invention younger than I am.”

These words had a power that went beyond a simple explanation.  It was a declaration, and she was gaining a kind of power through it.  I could feel it.</div>Ahahahahaaaaa this is <em>fascinating</em>- fascinating because I <em>agree</em> with her, that all these are human inventions- that the mere idea of Other is a human invention, and that it's all as meaningless as it is full of meaning. But she still seems to harken back to a more powerful truth, a truth absent of invention, and it's <em>that</em> that I disagree with. There were no Others before you saw them there, Mara. Before <em>someone</em> saw them there. Though they may have claimed to have come before you, they are no more than that which you drew yourself from the land.</span>

“Invention.  But at the core, there is truth.  I have not counted, but I can still be utterly confident in saying that I have woken up in the same place for more than nine million of your days.  I have gathered, hunted, cooked and eaten the same foods on those same days.  I have been born, bled for the first time, and been reborn on more than one thousand occasions.  The wheel of life and death turns forward and I am an indelible part of it, especially here.  This is a pattern, this is my ritual.  Now tell me, what is the truth of this.  What does it make me?”</div>But that, too is an invention. An adjacent one to the ones you despise. You haven't seen enough to know truth, you've just been around long enough to get stuck in your ideas so <em>thoroughly</em>, that to you they might seem more solid than anything. You've built up these ideas, so that they might have more reality that what you see around you, but that reality is nonetheless based on the invention.</span>

Roxanne shot him a dirty look.

“Roxanne and I legitimately thought Blake was going to murder us in cold blood.  That’s how fucked up we are, as a family.  Let us live, we continue to fuck up the other families, screw with or kill Johannes, and Jacob’s Bell becomes worse for all the people you hate.

“I know I’m already asking for and taking so much, but… can we please not call him Russel?  I really can’t picture us as a Russel.”

“Ross?”  I asked.  “Russ?”

“Ugh.  Awful,” she said, but she smiled a little.

I managed the smallest smile back.

“Rusty?” I offered.

“Forgive me!  I give up!” Rose said.  “I yield!”Rose nodded, then hesitated.

“What?”

“I have one thing I need to ask for.”

I went still.

“I know I’m already asking for and taking so much, but… can we please not call him Russel?  I really can’t picture us as a Russel.”

“Forgive me!  I give up!” Rose said.  “I yield!”</div>Just to make me feel <em>that much worse</em> about it, we have the first moment in a long while that Rose and Blake seem like siblings to me- or barring that, at least actual friends.</span>

I was frozen in place as I watched her continue onward.

The tension, anger, and stillness eased out of me as I saw her raise a hand to wipe at one eye, then the other.

Not a smirk.  Just overwhelmingly relieved.</div>yeah, I'm my own kind of relieved by this, even as it's <em>awful</em> to go through.</span>

“Monster,” she replied.

“You’re going to break your word,” I told her.  “I’m not picky, but I want you to start by telling us what, if any, involvement you have in Jacob’s Bell being swallowed up by the abyss.”

“Start?” the young crone asked me.

“Start.  Because when you’ve told us that, you’re going to swear oaths and you’re going to break them.  Over and over, until we have no doubt that you’ve relinquished all relationships with spirits and the practice.”</div>Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha</span>

You’re stopping the wheel from turning.  I don’t think you’re capable.  You have no choice but to swear it, because if you swear that oath, you get to live to the end of this lifespan.

“Blood Hags survive for as long as they do by taking the lives of others,” Tiff said.  “Not to be confused with sanguine hags, like Bathory.

“Yes,” Mara said.  “In the time you’ve wasted here with me, he has left his demesne.  Until I forswore myself, I was watching.  Paying attention to my surroundings.  If you leave now, and your path isn’t barred, you should get there in time.  But your path will be barred.  You’ve lost, for your arrogance.”</div>What!?

<span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>Lens</strong> 
Declarative: The lens is small, easily carried, and may represent a more subtle or thoughtful approach to problems. It relies heavily on the eyes, so the wearer is likely observant to begin with. A lens provides a new perspective, but a lens constantly worn may suggest ignorance, naivete, or at the very least an attachment to a particular worldview. 

Authoritative: The lens is used to observe, but also to focus. Given that the use of most implements involves focusing power in some way, this is not unique, but the lens focuses on a single point in three-dimensional space, and may be suited to working with raw power. A lens also filters what comes through it, and may be used to select for a particular kind of power. A more passive wearer may also use it mostly for its observational qualities, allowing them to see far more than the average practitioner.

Socio-cultural: Although glass lenses were not invented until around the 1300s, practitioners have been using crystal to refocus light for centuries. The lens used to be wielded only by monks and lords with the means to afford crystal, but can be found commonplace among practitioners today. Pre-existing need for vision correction is a large factor in whether this is chosen as an implement.</span>

<span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>Mask</strong> 
Declarative: A mask hides its wearer’s appearance. It is in most cases unmoving, portraying a single emotion or state of being despite what may lie beneath (see what I did there? Lie beneath? Get it?). The mask is an outward expression of identity, and pulls its wearer towards that identity. It is overtly deceptive, usually ostentatious, and appearance-oriented. 
 
Authoritative: The mask is expressive, deceptive, and sociological in its use. It alters both how the wearer is seen, and how the wearer sees, and the power it channels is likely to be of an illusory or emotional nature.
 
Socio-cultural: The mask is involved in many sacred rituals for numerous organizations, and has occasionally been taken en-masse by a specific sect or people, symbolizing thier unity as a single force, a single identity. These groups make up the vast majority of mask-wearers. Occasionally a mask from a long-dead organization or people will be taken by an individual in order to symbolize their dedication to the values of that</span>
